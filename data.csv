I think he feels let down and disappointed. Especially since it was right next to the $60.
he's pretty mad.  the chances of winning 30 were as good; or so; as winning 0.  also; he had a pretty good chance of winning 60; not as great as the others; but fair enough.  so winning nothing while having pretty good odds of winning something made him mad.
Chris is very disappointed not to have won any money. He saw that his odds were more that 50/50 that he would win $30 or $60. Chris is hopeful that he might win money on the next spin.
I don't think he feels good at all.  He didn't win anything
He probably feels a little bit disappointed. However; he was doing well before; so he probably still has hope.
Jake is sad.  He's disappointed because he expected something based on the odds; but he knew there was a chance of winning nothing. It still doesn't make him feel better.
Alex is disappointed that his no-risk-all-reward gamble has yielded no reward. The only unfavorable outcome possible has happened to him.
Upset that he didn't win anything.
Not again! Chris got $0 earlier too. This is totally unfair. Sad! Despair! Couldn't have been worse.
I think Alex is very disappointed
I think he feels very disappointed.  He got very unlucky.
He is sad he didnt win anything.
He is disappointed and sad. He probably is very upset that he didn't get to get any money out of the spin.
very disappointed
Jacob must be disappointed since he had the same chance of winning $30 as the $0 he actually won.
Frank felt sad for not winning anything.
Alex is bummed out. Thought he had a good chance to win more.
Alex feels bad. He spun and won nothing. For him this was a pointless exercise .
Charlie is royally pissed.  He didn't win a single dollar.  He's angry and irritable and won't soon forget his $0 spin.  Charlie probably wishes he could spin it again and at least come out with some sort of dollar amount.
He feels pretty bad. The odds were in his favor to walk away with at least some prize money but instead he has nothing. 
I think he feels disappointed. He didn't win anything.
Very disappointed that he didn't win any money at all. 
Pretty dang happy!
I think hes somewhat relieved. The $0 takes up a large percentage of the wheel. Hes most likely happy he at least got the $30
I think David feels pretty good about winning the $30.  There were pretty good odds of him landing on 0.
bad
He is very exited! He didn't expect to win anything. He feels lucky.
He feels excited and happy and relieved that the wheel did not land on $0. Might feel less disappointed since he won some money but not the maximum amount. 
I think Alex feels excited; but he knew he held a slighter better chance of winning some money rather than zero since the portion of the wheel representing zero is slightly smaller. He probably feels justified in receiving some money; yet wishes he had won the larger amount.
He is some what glad that he won 30 dollars because the chances of him winning were very low\n
relieved!  The pointer ALMOST landed on $0 but at the last minute it rolled over to $30.  He is very excited to win some money.
Yay money! There was a big chance that he could have gotten nothing. He should feel relieved.
Wow ;josh i really surprized . he feels like he just beat the odds.
happy. justifies his outcome by saying he could have easily walked away with nothing
Probably relieved that he did not land on the $0 but could have been happy doubling his money. So pretty neutral.
Felt ok; 30 is better than zero
Although Charlie is a little sad that he didn't get the $60; he is happy that he is walking away with at least $30.  With such a big chance on the wheel landing on $0; he was nervous that he'd end up with nothing.
I think he feels happy and relived. There was a relatively large chance that he would walk away without winning anything.
I think he is relieved that he didn't land on $0; but wishes he landed on $60.
James is relieved that he won $30 as opposed to no money; but he still wishes he would have won the greater amount of money.
He felt okay.
David is pretty happy. He has won something; he could've won nothing.
Uggggggh - he's probably feeling jipped. This was so close!!!
Content and satisfied that he won money at all; yet somewhat upset he didnt get the highest amount. 
He is relieved he didn't get 0 because of how close he came to getting 0. He is probably disappointed that he didn't 60 but glad that he got something.
Eric must be happy he a least won something. 30 is better than nothning
James is excited about winning anything at all.  That $0 slot on the wheel is very large and he was very nervous about it prior to spinning the wheel.
George is probably upset that he did not win more; but happy that he won money.
He is really happy. The chances of winning 60 dollars was small. He wasn't expecting to get any money at all.
Woohoo! Big Winna!
Since $60 is a maximum he can win; I'm sure Alex feels great!
He probably feels great because he won the largest amount possible. Even more so because he avoided the $0; which was the largest portion.
He feels awesome
good
Frank feels very elated! He won the highest amount and has earned some extra cash.
Chris is happy that he won $60; which is the largest amount on the wheel. 
Jake is thrilled. Not only did we win the max prize but he didn't land on 0$!
He felt very disappointing.
I think he was extremely excited that he won the most available out of the least amout of chances to win.
He probably feels pretty lucky. He had a small chance of winning $60; but he won it!
He is excited because he barely won the maximum prize.  he is also relieved because the no prize was a large portion of the board.
Steve is thrilled he didn't land on $0 since it had the best chance.
Jacob must feel incredibly happy about his $60 win. He won the most amount of money and had the smallest probability of winning it. He couldn't have wished for a better outcome.
The player will be very excited with the result as it is the highest amount on the wheel and it is the grand prize.
Mike will be very happy for winning the highest prize.
David feels awesome because he not only got the highest amount; but it was also the smallest section which made it unlikely to get.
Glad and lucky for wining the largest amount of money available.
David is going wild!  He's so excited to have won the highest amount with the smallest odds of winning. He feels lucky!
Surprised. He had a better chance at getting the two lower amounts but he won the most.
Pumped up!! That was the least likely and the most awesome. I bet he's jumping around like those weirdos on the Price is Right.
david is happy.\ndavid is excited.\nglad he didn't zero  out or get the lesser $30.
Happy because he won the largest amount of $. Probably lucky too because it was the smallest area and he landed on it.
Happy and relieved
Super pumped he hit the highest
David was probably very happy and excited he won the highest amount with the least odds.  Combined with the $0 prize it added the thrill of getting nothing.
James is super excited about winning the $60 as it is the maximum amount on the wheel and he also had a large chance of not winning anything at all.
Steve feels amazing that he has won the largest amount with a small chance! He is ready to play more!
Josh is probably very excited that he got $60; and moreso that he didn't get $0. He probably feels very happy and lucky.
Charlie was elated to win the largest amount on the wheel and in the smallest section of the wheel.
I think he'd feel somewhat happen yet somewhat disappointed. Im sure he was hoping for a larger amount of money; but Im sure hes happy he got something.
He felt okay.
I think he would have felt like it was expected. Overall; he had a 50% chance that it would land on $10 anyway. He might be a little disappointed though.
I think that is what he expected since the 10 amount is very large
He probably feel glad that he won something. But at the same time he would be disappointed that he didn't win 75 dollars. 
Disappointed he only won 10 bucks.
He felt disappointed as he got the lowest amount of money.
Charlie knew he had a 50% or greater chance of winning only $10; but having come so close to a higher prize has made him unhappy with his $10 prize.
let down that he only got 10$. happy that he didnt lose and gt nothing.
He feels like it is expected because there was a 50% chance he would win 10 $ so anything more wold be exciting but he knew he would at last win 10 $
I'm sure he's bummed.  The percentages were favoring $10.  It's better to get something than nothing.  It might might hurt a little though.
He feels content but would've been happier if he won the $35 or $75.
I think David feels a little unhappy even though he knows he held the highest chance of winning the lowest amount of money. He probably figured that is the way it would work out.
Predicatable
Disappointed; but not shocked. His odds were definitely for this result; though he probably would've rather had the $75
Eric knew he was most likely to win $10 since it was the most likely outcome; so he isn't too surprised. He's slightly disappointed that he also had a $50 chance of winning more than $10.
He is disappointed he won the least amount.
Probably upset even though he expected it.
He probably feels a little disappointed; but unsurprised; since he had a 50% chance of getting $10 anyway. It's better than $0; though.
He was disappointed because it was the lowest prize although not entirely unsurprised.
George is very happy
Charlie is probably not too happy.  The amount he won is the lowest amount possibly; and it is not a substantial amount of money.  Plus; the odds were against him to win a high amount because there was a 50% chance that he would end up with only $10.
He feels kinda eh about the whole thing.  He was most likely to win $10; but it barely seems like a prize since he had a chance to win $75.
Tom is disappointed right now. I bet he was hoping for a better spin.
Pretty let down; but not surprised since $10 was the largest sized portion. He was still hoping to win more.
ugh i only won that much
he gets disappointed
Scott is upset by his winnings; because that is the lowest amount anyone has won today
Alex is probably probably mildly disappointed he only won $35.  Even though the greater odds was for $10; its still much lower than the $75 prize.
Relieved that it wasn't the lower amount since it was a higher likelihood.
I think Jake is excited.  He knows that $10 is the reasonable amount to expect.  He would have been happier to get $75; though.
Tom probably feels very good about his earnings. Even though he didn't win $75; he still did very well and is happy.
He felt great because $75 is really hard to get because that particular section is pretty small.  He got very lucky!
He felt well but would have felt better if he got $75.
Well Bob is pleased to win the $35; as the $10 section of the wheel was the largest section and his chance to win the $35 was less.
I think he's probably a bit disappointed; but $35 is still $35!
He is disappointed he didnt win the largest amount but satisfied for not winning the least.
He was so close!  He feels happy he won the 2nd biggest prize; but a little dissapointed that he was so close to the big one
He probably feels somewhat happy; and somewhat surprised. But he probably also wished it would have kept going to land on the 75
he is happy he got the middle amount but sad because the top amount is double what he could have won
content. he won more than the least possible.
He's probably a little disappointed. I bet Tom wanted to win more than that. He probably was going for that bog $75
I think he would like that he won that amount.  He probably thought he would get $10 because it was the biggest but he got $35 which is in the middle and $25 more than the smallest.
Steve must be still happy. He could have got the amount of 10 but got 35 so its still good money
He probably expected that he would win 10 dollars since it was the most likely. He probably is okay with 35 dollars but would have liked 75 dollars.
disappointed about not winning the $70 but glad it wasn't $10
Chris is overjoyed e won money he did not have before hand
Surprised. He could have gotten the lowest amount because that amount dominates space on the wheel.
happy because he won the middle amount
He felt okay.
I think John feels alright about the $35 prize.  The odds were in favor of landing on the $10 prize.
Mike should be happy.  He had more than 50% chance to win only $10
He would feel excited winning the biggest prize of $75
Even though it wasn't the largest amount; he is still glad as there was more then fifty percent chance; he could of gotten lower than that.
Buy me some groceries.  Some drinks for tonight.  Would never spend it all i feel lucky.
Jake must be quite happy with his outcome. The $35 prize is much better than the $10 prize; although he likely figures that the $75 prize would have been nice.
Steve is happy with his 2nd prize amount. He's happy he avoided the 3rd prize; but upset that he didn't win the 1st prize.
Eric lets out a sigh of relief that the wheel didn't land on $10.  There was slightly over a 50% chance that it would.  He's happy with his $35.
I think Bob wishes he had won the largest amount; but feels lucky he did not win the lowest amount.
He must have felt very happy. He got the best prize on the wheel! 
He won the highest amount on the wheel; he is probably excited! He probably thought he was going to win the 10 since it is to big; so he is probably surprised.
I think he would be very happy. That is the largest figure available. woohoo for him.
He felt amazing!
He is very happy because he won the most amount of money that he could.
Lucky since the section was so small and his chances of getting less were good!
He feels lucky because he keeps winning the amount on the wheel that he has the lowest probability of winning. Plus; now he can pay his phone bill too!
I Felt excited. I felt happy that they won the largest amount. 
He feels great about winning the biggest prize!
I'm sure he's elated since the odds were against him.
Elated!
Tom is probably feeling very good.  He has hit the highest amount with the smallest chance of winning.  You can do a few things with 75 dollars these days.
he is as happy as you can get by playing this game. max happiness. lowest odds; but highest payoff.
Wow...the odds were against  him but he won the biggest prize....He is exstatic!
Wow; elated smallest chance to win and he won! Better chance to win $10 and he won $75 his lucky day.
Better than the previous contestants before him
Very lucky that it landed in the smallest section with highest payout.I think he would feel like he beat the odds against him.
Super pumped he hit the highest 
He is super excited that he won the highest dollar amount; because the odds were against him for the smallest slice. He is very happy.
It's the highest he can win... that makes him very happy. 
James is surprised and feels lucky. He did not expect to land on the smallest space and win the largest amount.
Tom is most likely extremely happy with his spin. The chance of winning $10 or $35 was much greater than spinning $75.
Scott feels great about winning.  The amount he won is quite a lot more than the other two amounts that he could have won.  Plus; the amount he won is quite substantial.  Finally; he had a much higher chance of winning only $10; so he is glad to have beat the odds of winning a much lower amount.
I think Mike feels excited about winning 75 dollars. He won the most money on the wheel.
He feels extra great! Very lucky! It landed on the smallest one; with the largest money! Great day!
I think he feels extremely surprised and happy. He got the most money possible; and this section of the wheel had the smallest probability associated with it.
He's feeling really lucky and excited - the $75 wasn't a very big section - he figured he'd get the $10 but he got the $75 so he's pretty excited.
I think Jake is extremely happy. He got the most amount of money with the smallest portion of the wheel!
Feels super excited. $75 is a lot!
He feels happy and excited that he won the maximum amount. He feels surprised that he won the maximum over the minimum. Does not feel disappointed or sad. 
Alex feels extremely happy and lucky. $75 was by far the least likely outcome and largest denomination.
Tom feels ecstatic that he has beaten the odds of winning a small prize; and is taking home the much-less-likely high prize amount.
Bob must be jumping of joy he had less than 25% of winning. he must be jumping of joy.
Jake is very happy to have won $75; especially since the wheel had almost stopped on $10. He also feels lucky since winning $75 had the smallest probability of the three possibilities. 
James felt excited.  Winning $75 when he had a higher chance of winning only $10 is awesome.
He probably feels very happy because he landed on the largest amount and very lucky because he landed on the smallest section.
Steve is glad about his results. That is the most he could get. I bet he is very satisfied with that spin.
good
good going Josh
really happy; won the most amount on the smallest part.
disappointed that the wheel landed on the smallest amount
He feels a little disappointed to say the least. The wheel is unfairly sectioned to only be able to win the smallest amount 50% of the time. He thinks it sucks.
Not great; there was close to a 50% chance of winning a higher amount; but at least he still won a little.
Disappointed that he didn't get $70 or $80.
Disappointed he didn't win more. He wished he had hit the $80
david is happy.\ndavid is excited.\nhe wishes it was $80 or $70.
sad because he won the lowest amount.
Tom feels disappointed.   He'd rather have won the 70 or $80 prize.   $15 still better than nothing for him though.
Alex probably felt a little disappointed.  He technically had a more than 50% chance of winning a much greater amount of money.
I think he would be a little upset with the amount he won.  But he should of saw going into it that $15 was the biggest and probably would be landed on the most.  He at least got some money.
Kindof disappointed. He won a little bit; which is good; but far less than he could have.
Disappointed; but not surprised.  He got the lowest prize but that had nearly the same odds as the two higher prizes combined.
He feels content because he now has $15 but not as happy as he would've if it was the $80.
Mike is probably happy to have more money than he started with but disappointed he didn't win more.
He would feel a bit disappointed cause he could of won a bigger prize.
Chris is probably disappointed at only winning $15.  Although it wasn't the best outcome; Chris knew this was the most probable result.
A little disappointed for not winning a larger amount; yet still glad to have won.
Josh is probably a little upset that he didn't earn one of the two higher prizes. However; he still made at least a little bit of money and therefore doesn't feel too upset.
I think Jacob feels dismayed to see that although he held the highest chance of winning a higher amount of money; the pointer landed within the smallest portion of the wheel. He probably feels only a bit unlucky.
He is not very satisfied because he was hopping to win the bigger draw
He is bummed out that he did not win more. He is disappointed. 
Josh could not be more displeased. He got 15 bucks after having above a 50% chance of getting at least 70!
Frank is okay with winning $15.  He knew that it would probably land there anyways (because it's the bigger part of the wheel).  Even though the other two prizes were slightly larger than half; he wasn't expecting to land in that portion.
Not happy; but not surprised. So close to winning the big money
Angry for being right on the line for $70
He is probably ecstatic; he is only $10 away from the max you can win. He also won free money; so how can you be angry?
He felt great because he can now pay his Cable TV bill this month!
I think he would be very happy with $70.00.
david is happy.\ndavid is excited.\nhe wishes it was $80; but glad it's not $15
He felt very excited given the probability was 50% that he would win only $15
Chris is excited and happy that he won $70. He feels that he beat the odds.
Pretty happy; he won the second highest prize and it's close to the maximum.
David feels lucky that he landed on the second largest prize. David thought for sure the odds were against him.
excellent
He is probably very satisfied with his spin. The chance of winning $70 was much smaller than the chance of him winning $15.
He is very excited because he won the middle amount and it is very close to the top amount he could win.  There is no disappointment because the middle amount is so much larger than the lowest and it is almost as much as the highest
Jacob is quite happy.   He avoided the low $15 winner and is very thankful for the $70 prize.
Feels good. 
Bob is happy that he won. The odds were against him winning that much; but his spin overcame those odds. He would have been happiest with $80; but he is satisfied with $70.
Charlie feels relief that he won the $70.  With a 50% chance of landing on the $15; he was a little nervous that it might land there.  He takes his winnings with a smile.
Frank is very happy with winning $70.  The odds were against him for winning that much; anyways.  I'm sure he would have enjoyed winning $80 instead; but it's not that much more money.
Excited and happy
yeah i won 70 bucks
Tom feels good did not win the highest amount but chance had him winning only $15.
Happy.  There was a fifty-fifty chance of getting a much lower amount; and the difference between the high and middle amount wasn't much so he'd be happy with the result overall.
I'm sure he feels pretty good.  It wasn't the highest amount available; but it's better than winning $15.  It's a solid win.
Charlie is probably very happy.
He probably feels about as happy as he would be if he had one $80. 
He is quite happy since the odds were significantly against him. He had a 50% chance of only making $15.
Lucky that it wasn't much lower. Happy.
Jake is surprised. He thought he was going to win $15
Alex feels happy; since he thought he might only win 15 dollars!
Happy that he won the highest amount.
George will be very happy because he just won the highest prize.
I think mike is over joyed! he just won the biggest prize of 80$.
Very Excited! He won the highest amount possible.
Jacob feels very happy and excite. He is also relieved; because he knows the odds were against him. 
He was feeling lucky; because he got the highest award. The highest award was hardest to get. He felt special; beating the odds.
Bob should feel great. He won the most he could. He even bested the odds since that piece is smallest and thus has the smallest chance of having it land there.
Chris must feel amazing after his win of $80. It is the smallest section of the wheel and it is worth the most amount of money. He couldn't hope for a better outcome. 
Excited and pumped that he won the highest amount possible. 
Super pumped he hit the highest
wow.......i am exited
He is happy that he hit the highest dollar amount on the wheel; and glad he didn't hit the largest slice for $15.
Chris received the highest amount; so he is very happy. He also feels lucky because the odds were against him to win that amount. It was more likely for him to receive $15; so he is thankful.
I think David would be happy because he won the biggest amount he could of won.  He may also be surprised that he won that because it is a smaller part of the wheel.
Tom is ecstatic; he won the maximum amount possible of $80 and he only had about a quarter chance of landing on that amount.
happy and glad hes on a winning streak
Bingo!  Jacob is feeling happy as he won the highest amount possible.  He had the smallest chance of getting that prize so he's feeling very blessed and hopes that the winning streak can continue!
He feels exceptionally great about winning this amount!
ecstatic about winning the highest amount
He's shocked. He's happy. This was more than he was expecting.
Eric feels very happy because there was a large chance he'd get $15 which is very little but he won 80 instead
He probably feels that he was unlucky. But he probably thinks that there was a good chance of the wheel landing on $20 anyways.
Disappointed
He feels some disappointment.
Eric will feel slightly robbed because he missed the largest prize by such a small amount. But still is happy to have won anything.
Jake is disappointed to win the largest amount of money; although he is not very surprised because his chances of winning 70 were slim.
Tom will take his 20$ and be happy 70$ would have been nicer though.
Charlie probably felt just okay about winning the $20. But better than nothing!
James just pocketed a twenty dollar bill.  That's twenty more than he had when he spun the wheel; and he's feeling great!
He's not terribly excited; but he figured it would end on $20 because of the size of the section.
Scott feels sad that he didn't at least win the $45.  He knew that winning the $70 was a long shot.  But he had felt confident that he'd have a pretty good chance at getting the $45.
Not surprising; but maybe disappointing because it's the lowest amount of money. It's not surprising though because that had the highest odds.
He's not surprised. He saw that the wheel appears to be rigged now. He wasn't expecting more.
bad
mad because it was so close to being 70$. let down that he didnt win more
Probably he expected this to happen but is also disappointed he didn't win more. But he probably is happy to have an extra 20 dollars regardless.
Disappointed he didn't win more.
Mike is indifferent about his winnings. He is happy to have $20 he did not have before; but he feels as though he has a pretty good chance at $45 and would of course rather have won that amount.
Pretty frustrated but a little happy he won something.
Happy yet disappointed. Because $20 is the lowest amount; but at least he won something.
He predicted he would win this amount; so he is not surprised
he his happy that he won the middle amount but sad he didn't win the highest
Happy he won the middle amount
He was probably satisfied. It wasn't the worst prize he could get; but it wasn't the best. Considering the $20 section is the largest; I bet he felt pretty relieved that he got an extra $25.
Happy
Jake feels ecstatic that on his very first spin; he has won 45 dollars! He smiles; and contemplates his next spin.
Pretty happy about it
im okey
Charlie was probably pretty happy with the outcome.  He managed to win the second highest amount possible.
normal
happy that he won the second largest amount
Can't feel bad about that. At least I didn't get the $20 which was equally likely!
Eric feels pretty happy. He didn't win the most but he didn't win the least either.
Jake is very content with winning 45 dollars. HE can comfort himself with the fact that he didn't get the least amount of money.  
I think hes pretty happy. There was a good chance he would hit the $20 but instead he got $45. Of course $70 would have been better but I think hed be pretty content with the $45
Eric is glad he won more than the most likely outcome; especially since there was a greater chance of winning $20.
Steve is happy and excited.  He won the average amount of the three values put together and he knew he had a small chance of winning the highest amount.  He's content and will take it.
He's happy about it - not super happy because it wasn't the highest amount but happy that it wasn't the lowest amount.
He probably feels neither lucky or unlucky because there was an almost equal chance of landing $45 and $20. 
Charlie was probably a little surprised he won the middle amount.  He was probably mildly content because the value was split between the two other options.
Scott is excited he won 45.00 more than he had before t6he game
He feels good with the 45 but wishes he had gotten the 70
He feels happy to have won this amount
He felt happy because the $45 is a good amount and he didn't see any chance of getting 70
He is happy 
Charlie should feel good about earning $45. Although $70 would have been better; $45 is still better than $20 and therefore is a good thing to leave with.
He feels okay with this.  It's not great; but he was more likely to get the lowest prize; and he did better.
John felt okay about winning $45 dollars.  It was the middle prize and still a respectable amount of money.
Jake feels very excited.  The pointer landed on the section with the smallest percentage of being hit; and received the most money from the wheel he could have
I think he feels really happy. He won the largest amount on the wheel.
I thinks he felt wonderful.  He won the biggest prize.  He is full of joy and excitement
George is ecstatic. He feels the odds were against this much money; and he is surprised and happy with the outcome.  He couldn't feel better.
James feels elated.  He has never won an amount of money this large before.  He feels on top of the world.
Very good
He feels excited and happy because he won the largest amount available on the wheel.
Steve felt great; because it landed on the highest award. The highest award was hardest to get; so he was happy. It was less likely to get that; so he was feeling lucky.
He feels very happy! He got the rarest and highest prize on the wheel. $75 is a good amount.
It's the maximum he can win. I think he's very happy. 
Scott is ecstatic about winning $70.  It appears to be the smallest part of the wheel and he got lucky enough that the pointer landed on it. 
David will be very happy for winning the highest prize.
Alex is happy to win. That $70 will probably be well spent. he's most likely loving this game.
Eric is very happy. He won the largest amount he could and had the smallest odds to do so.
I think Bob feels great to realize although he held the highest chance of winning one of the lower amounts of money; the pointer landed within the smallest portion of the wheel. He probably feels very lucky.
I think Mike feels good because he won the most money on the wheel
Chris is excited he bet the odds and won the $70 amount.
David hit the jackpot and feels lucky to get the largest prize. 
Mike could not be happier for winning the most money on the wheel. He is leaving contented. 
I feel that the odds where the 20 dollars.  Glad they got the 70 dollars
Mike is very happy as his chance to win the $70 was the least with the most reward.
Very pleased. His win is significantly more than the minimum win would have been.
Eric is most likely very satisfied with his spin because the chance of spinning $70 was a little lower than spinning $45 and much lower than spinning $20.
Tom is in absolute shock; after his first winning spin. Tom dances and hollers; as he spins with excitement. Tom; is feeling really great now.
Josh feels very good for getting the largest amount on the smallest section.
I think he is happy that he won $70.
Frank should be very happy.  He obviously won the game.  70 is respectable.  Again; we should all be happy to win something.  He obviously did very well.
Chris is thrilled with his victory. He landed not only on the smallest part of the wheel but also on the one that earned him the most money. He could not have asked for a better result to his spin.
Alex has landed on the smallest part and the most reward. He's very happy!
happy. won most money possible. 
John is very pleased with his spin. Today he's taking home 70$ which is the largest amount on the board.
i think he feels ok
it is not bad
he probably wishes he won the $95; but is happy that he won something
John is exicited but a little dissapointed. He really wanted the 95$. But 30 is better than nothing.
disappointed that he got the least amount
very disappointed since the odds were with him on making the higher amount.
Alex is probably disappointed that he only won $30; since the odds where in his favor to win $95.
He is bummed out that he did not win more.
He feels like sad. He gets disappointed and got angry.
Seeing as he ended up so close to 50 as well; he probably is bummed out that it didn't end up at the 50. And he probably is sad that he didn't get to be in the 95 section. 
He's kind of bummed out. He thought he'd get 95 or 50 dollars. But 30 dollars is better than nothing.
Charlie is a tad bit disappointed that it wasn't more. Charlie thought he'd land on the larger area which was the highest prize amount.
Upset he only won 30 bucks.
James would feel good to have won; but also slightly disappoints that he didn't win a larger prize since the odds were so favorable for the $95 as compared to either of the other possible prizes.
Very upset at the small amount of money
George would probably be somewhat sad that he didn't win $50 or $95; but at least he gets to walk away with something. I imagine he's happy for that.
I think Charlie feels disappointed -- he had better odds of earning a higher amount of money.  He was probably hoping for $95.
Bob is happy he won $30; but wishes it were more. He can add $30 to the $90 he won earlier; for a total of $120.
Pretty let down. The largest sized portion was $95 so he was expecting to win that.
David is displeased. He had a higher chance of landing on the $95; but he instead landed on the second largest piece; equaling $30.
Charlie is annoyed that he had a much greater chance of winning either $50 or $95. 
Not happy.  He got the low amount and the chances of that happening weren't really all that good going in.  Add to that the fact that the big amount was the biggest spot on the wheel and he can't be very happy about the end result.
NO! Just a bit more and Josh could have won $50 instead. Rotten luck! 
His odds for hitting this slice were somewhat large; but the odds for $95 were better so he is disappointed that he didn't hit that.
I think Tom is a bit disappointed; but he feels its still okay.
Jacob just feels decent. Not only because he is a poor sport; but because the largest amount and second largest make up the majority of the wheel.
Kinda bummed and feeling unlucky - the biggest section was the $95 so he felt like he had a pretty good chance of taking home some good money; but no.
Scott is disappointed that he only won $30. Scott is hopeful that if he spins again; he will win more. Scott prepares and is unsure of his next spin.
Wishes he had won $95 since chance was highest. He won lowest amount possible so not so happy.
He would be in a good mood winning $30
not happy 
James is not thrilled with the outcome. He really wanted it to come out differently.
Moderately happy and excited. Slightly disappointed or sad maybe.
He is glad about his winnings which is the middle amount but disappointed he did not win the higher amount of $95.
He feels good; not great. The $95 prize had a larger chance than $50 and the amount of the prize is pretty much double! $50 is nice but he will certainly imagine what he could have won.
He is probably a bit disappointed given where it landed (so close to 95) and wishes he could have gotten the 95 dollars. But he probably is happy that he got 50 dollars.
The middle amount; which is good. This was interesting because it has a pretty even odds.
Jake is content with the result.  He's not sad because he won some money; although he's disappointed to not win the highest dollar amount since it had the highest odds.
Happy! It's $50 more than he had before.
He probably feels equally lucky and unlucky because he won the prize in the middle of the lowest and highest prizes.
happy im not sure what else to say
Still excited but somewhat down that he didn't win the highest; but he still won higher than the lowest. 
Happy; I imagine. It's not the most; it's not the least. 
He feels pretty good. It could have been the 30; they're all large chunks of the wheel. He wouold have preferred $96 (almost 2x the prize he won) but 50 is good.
I think Chris feels pretty proud of himself for winning $50
Bob probably feels pretty good about his win. He won the middle amount of money but may feel a little let down that he didn't win the full $95 considering his chances were the highest there. 
Satisfied but somewhat disappointed;  Won the middle prize but highest prize had best odds of winning.
Scott must feel happy that he won the second highest outcome on the wheel. Of course; he must be a little upset that he didn't win the $95 prize; but at least he didn't win the lowest outcome!
He feels like he missed out on the big one. That it wasn't the highest award; so he felt bad. I don't think it was a good feeling for frank; due to not hitting jackpot.
He feels good but lightly disappointed but mostly good.
Cool. Could've been worse; could've been better. 
50 is ok. wish it were 95. Better than 30 anyway.
George is probably neutral about the outcome here. He had a somewhat even chance of winning anything; and he got the middle result. I wouldn't be sad about it; I would probably be happy if it happened to me. I'm sure George feels the same way.
Awesome! He won the most amount of money possible and is very happy and surprised. 
He's also happy. He won $95; which is the maximum amount. 
He would feel great he got the largest section with the highest payout.
Bob would be happy and content he won the highest amount you could win. He is extremely excited. 
Happy and excited. Felt like he had a good chance since the section was large
He would be very very happy
James probably feels really excited! The other two choices are so low; he's very happy it landed on the one thats significantly higher than the others
He felt good; he got the highest award. Although it was easier to get that; so he does not feel as special as someone who won the hard way. That is due to the space being biggest. 
He is delighted.  He just won the maximum prize; even though this was the most likely of the 3 outcomes.
He is happy! He won the highest amount out of all 3
he is thrilled that he won that amount. He is probably glad that it didn't touch the other sections.
Jacob is super happy; he won the biggest amount on the roulette and is very excited to have done it.
Charlie probably feels great because he won the most amount of money available. He had a really good chance of getting this amount but just the fact that he won the most would lead to positive responses. 
George is very excited to win the largest amount of money; but again; he would have been extremely disappointed to get anything less since that was the largest section of the wheel.
\n\nHe is very happy because he won the most amount of money that he could.\n
Frank is overwhelmed by joy. Frank is smiling from ear to ear and jumping up and down.
He would be very excited just winning $95
I bet he feels awesome!  The percentages worked in his favor for a big win.  Winning $95 is great.
Very good.  He won the highest prize which was significantly higher value than the other two prizes.
amazing
excited he just won the top prize. he is happy he didnt lose.
Excited
I think Mike feels good because he won the most money on the wheel.
John has to feel great; he won the maximum amount he could win of $95.
Scott feels satisfied that he has won the best available prize and that the high odds of this outcome helped his chances. 
Ecstatic and lucky. 
Mike is ecstatic with his winnings. He would have been okay with $30 and excited about $50. Given that the largest portion was for $95; though; he had hoped to land on that very spot.
happy. won the most money possible. doesnt matter that this was the most probable outcome.
Mike is happy about winning $95.  It's the most amount of money on the wheel and also the largest section; so he must have known winning that much was the most probably result.
Happy!
Bob is ecstatic that he won the maximum amount of money from this wheel. He had a greater than 50/50 chance of winning less money; so he's pretty cool with the outcome.
Frank was upset. He really wanted that 100$.
Frank would be somewhat happy he won $25 but disappointed it was not more money. 
Should still feel happy to have won a prize and not been penalized or won ZERO. But still; I can sympathize with only winning to smallest available prize. 
Disappointed that he didn't win $100; but happy that he at least won some money.
He won something; and he's probably glad for that.  However; of the possible options of winning; this was the lowest amount.  He is probably a bit disappointed.
He feel totally bump right now. He just missed the $100 mark. Oh well; he won $25 nevertheless. 
Steve pretty much figured 25 was what he would win. Still he was hoping against odds for 100
contempt. The $25 portion is the largest; so the odds of getting $60 is really slim. The odds of getting $100 even slimmer
david is happy.\ndavid is excited.\nhe wishes it was $100 or even $60.
Disappointed since he won the lowest amount that you are able to win with a spin. 
Eric is pleased enough with his winnings; but not as happy as he'd have been with $60 or $100. However; given how much more likely his outcome was; he half-expected it anyway.
George is okay with winning $25; but the $60 would have been better as he had about equal odds of winning $60.  He's fine with not winning $100; though.
Eric probably is glad for the $25; but is disappointed in not winning the larger amounts on the wheel; which where better odds.
Disappointed to be so close to $100
I'm sure he's disappointed he didn't get the higher amount.
Happy
Disappointed that he did not win the big prize but still happy cause he won a prize
He is happy he won money but disappointed that he lost out on the higher deals\n
Happy. He didn't expect a big prize so 25 is fine
David's upset he didn't win the most amount. However; it's $25 more than he had.
the odds of winning every time is usually a percentage
Psyche! Tom states loudly!  He just won $25 and is pretty pleased.
Josh is upset. He got the least amount possible. That's less than everyone else
Scott is a tad upset. He was very close to winning $60. Even though he landed on the one with the most chance; he still had a shot at much more money.
Frank is not surprised to win the 25 dollars as it was the largest section so his chance was the best; but it was the least reward.
good
Ok; but a little bummed
I think he feels fine.  He knew that $25 was the most likely outcome; although he probably wishes he had landed on the higher amount.
not good; not good at all.  forgetting that the odds were with him to win 25; john only pays attention to the fact that he has won only 1/4 of the highest prize amount there is.  john's a very mad and sad boy today.
Disappointed.  He won the lowest prize and it was significantly lower than the other prizes.
Very excited to win a big prize. 
I think david felt good about his win; because he won a fair amount.
Not bad! I'll take that! Pretty good odds!
Eric won the middle prize. 100$ looked nice but 60$ is still a nice chunk of change. 
The player will feel excited at the result as it is a big amount to win in a gamble like the spin wheel. Of course; He would have would have loved to win the highest prize of $100; but still will be thankful for this amount.
He is happy but a little disappointed that he did not win $100.\n\n
He feels great! He could have just as easily walked away with a measly $25. Sure; it would have been nice to pocket $100; but $60 is just fine with him.
I feel good going to the good will to spend some cash.  Get me a radio.  get me some ice cream then be happy all day.
Josh has mixed feelings; he won $60 but he really wanted the $100; yet he feels glad because the other option was only $25
Charlie should be happy. He got the middle amount and had almost the same chance to get the lowest amount. So he did well.
I'm sure he's happy.
Pretty happy; he won some money but not the highest.
He feels pretty good about winning the amount that he has spun. But not the best.
He's very happy about winning. He would have been happy with any amount. He can't wait to spend it.
Happy he won 60 dollars.
david is happy.\ndavid is excited.\nhe wishes it was $100; but glad it's not $25.
Great seeming as that was the greatest odd
Eric probably feels pretty decent. He won the middle amount of money but may be a little let down that he didn't win the full $100.
Mike is probably glad he won the $60; but had hoped for the $100; which is a lesser odd of winning.
He is probably happy to some degree.  He received a nominally good prize.
Frank has to be somewhat happy with the result.  He won the middle amount of $60 and had a large chance to win less than that.
Eric should be happy.  Again; not the lowest and not the highest.  He beat the odds of a lower amount.  60 is quite a bit higher than 25.
James is most likely satisfied with his spin. He was probably expecting to spin $25 since that is a majority of the wheel.
John feels satisfied with the $60.   Much better than receiving 25 or lesser amount.
ok with the win
He feels happy and excited that he won a fair amount of money. Probably does not feel all that surprised at the outcome. May feel a little disappointed or sad that he didn't win the maximum. 
Mike is happy with the $60 but would have been happier with the $100
Tom had equal chance of winning $25 and $60 so he is happy he won the higher amount.
Pretty good.
Bob feels pleased; since it was equally likely he'd get $60 or $25; so he feels lucky. He's a tiny bit disappointed that he didn't get $100; but didn't expect it very much.
I think Chris is excited he won 60 dollars.
He feels good; he is satisfied with his $60; he would have liked more but is not disappointed.
Tom probably feels excited and happy. $100 was the best possible outcome; and also the one with the smallest chance; so he may also be surprised.
He felt good; because that is the hardest one to get. It has a small space; and largest award. So now he will get the best award and be happier. He won the best deal out of all.
Bob feels very happy. He won the highest amount of money with the lowest probability of being landed on.
Jake is jumping with joy. Jake is smiling and is anxiously awaiting his next spin.
Tom feels great! Although no matter where he landed he would've earned money; the $100 makes him feel amazing.
James must be ecstatic. He won the largest prize offered by the wheel; and the one with the smallest probability; at that.
Weeeeeeeee! I think Alex is ecstatic right now. Not only did he win the most amount of money on the wheel but the $100 portion was the smallest; so the least probable to hit. I think hes very excited and very happy!
He is very happy.  He just won the maximum prize of  $100; and it wasn't that likely he would have.
He is excited and surprised! He is jumping up and down with excitement
I think he feels extremely surprised and happy. He got the most money he could and landed on the spot with the lowest probability.
One in three paid off this time! Woohoo!
He is very very excited to have won the best prize; and having been such a small chance he would have won it.   There was a more than 50% chance he would win only 25 so I bet that feels great.
David should feel great. While he won the most he could. He bear the odds since the $100 portion was the smallest on the wheel and his odds were most like to have won $25 and he got much more then that.
\nHe is very happy because he won the most amount of money that he could.\n\n
he will be very surprised and so happy.
James has to be pleased with his spin.  His spin resulted in the most amount of money possible even though it meant landing on the smallest section of the wheel.
Jake feels amazing that he won the largest amount & wants to win more!
wow i won 100 bucks i cant believe it
He is excited because he won the maximum prize.  Especially since it was the smallest portion of the board.
Wow! He would feel incredibly lucky!
He's extremely excited and surprised that he won the largest amount on the wheel.
Scott is extremely happy about winning $100.  He'll cheer wildly and feels like this is his lucky day.
Very lucky and happy since it was the smallest section
Kind of disappointed
He probably felt glad about getting some money; but disappointed that it wasn't at least $45. There was a higher chance of him winning $25; but it was still very possible for him to win $45.
John is still happy at least he won something.
He feels diappointed. Any potion but the one he got would have been better.
Jacob is happy that he has at least won some money. He is upset that he couldn't win more.
Wish I had won 80.  Cant buy anything with 25 BUCKS? WELL Going to buy a pizza.
disappointed it wasnt a larger amount
Happy that he won a prize
Bob is disappointed as the largest section of the wheel would have been $80 to win and the $25 section which he won was the smallest.
Great but also maybe hoping it was higher
He's disappointed. He thought he'd get 45 or 80 dollars. But he's ok with just 25.
happy he won something. he was dissapointed it was the smallest prize.
Jake is happy to have won some money. He can't help thinking; though; that he missed out on $80; which he actually had a slightly larger chance of winning. He hopes he wins $80 on his next spin and knows his odds are pretty good.
Disappointed. The chances of winning the most money was even with the others so the odds were in his favor but he still lost.
Frank is disappointed he didn't win a larger amount since the odds where in favor of a larger winning.
Mike is disappointed.  His spin landed on the smallest section of the wheel; and he was only a few inches from almost doubling his money.  
Steve got the lowest prize. Drats! Oh well; 25$ is better than nothing. 
Josh was probably disappointed he won the lowest amount.  Each section had about a 33% chance and he probably figured it would at least land one of the other two instead.
david is happy.\ndavid is excited.\nhe wishes it was $80 or even $45.
He felt okay.
Though it is the least amount the player will be happy to have won this. As 'something' is better than 'nothing'.
Pretty disappointed. He had a good chance of winning either $45 or $80; but still ended up with only $25.
Because it stopped so close to 80 he probably bummed out having not won the 80 dollars. He probably also is bummed out not to have more than 25; but probably is glad regardless.
He is excited to win anything for free; especially given the other amounts gradually increased and were mnot huge amounts for him to feel dissapoined about
I think he feels disappointed.
not very good as he got the lowest amount
25 is not a bad win.  I'm starting to feel board watching the game. 
Disappointed
He's extremely pleased he won; even though it's small. The odds seemed quite fair. He looks forward to going to lunch.
He is disappointed that he hit this slice for the $25 when the odds were the same to at least hit the $45 and greater for the $80.
Bob is not too excited that he just won $25. He leaves disappointed. 
He feels a little happy probably not that excited to win the minimum but happy that he won something. He may feel slightly surprised that he didn't win more money. He is probably a bit sad and disappointed that he didn't win more money. 
Upset.
I think he probably feels pretty good!
I think Josh is reasonably happy and satisfied with his winnings; particularly because he received the second highest amount.
happy; since he won the middle amount.
He is probably glad he won the $45 amount but wishes he had won the $80.
Frank feels good.  He could of won $25..but won $45 instead.  He's pretty happy.
Like he could have won more money
He feels a little disappointed since it was so close to winning the 80 dollars which he mostly expected because it took up half of the wheel.
I think he felt somewhat disappointed. The chance to win $80 was large relative to the other spots on the wheel; yet that wasn't what he ended up with.
He felt okay but would have rather the higher amount.
He is happy that he won the $45 over the $25; but that large chunk of the wheel for $80 may make him disappointed.
Relieved. He almost landed on the least amount; so getting the middle amount would be a relief.  However; when he started he was probably hoping for the highest amount since it occupied the biggest spot on the board; so there would be a little disappointment in that regard.
he's kinda bummed; but still kinda happy.  he was going to walk away with something; so that was a plus.  losing out on 80 when the chances for getting it were kinda high; sucks and he's bummed about that.  but winning 45; which is just over half of 80; isn't too bad; and still 20 more than the lowest; so that makes him kinda happy.
Bob still feels good because he won the middle amount available.
Frank is disappointed that he didn't win $80 because it takes up the largest percentage of the wheel.
Frank is angry because he felt like the 80$ prize was in the bag. Still; he avoided the 25$ low prize. 
he feels little bit appointment.
John is pretty happy. He won $45 which isn't a small amount.
Pretty good.
He is feeling lucky. Still not winning the lowest prize. 
Not too bad for John. could be better. 
$45 is a good amount of money; so probably happy and relieved to not have got @25.
Charlie is pretty happy at winning the $45; he is smiling; laughing and is feeling lucky today. 
Split the difference! Can't complain!
He is disappointed he didnt win the most but satisfied he didnt win the least.
He feels good about winning $45; but wishes the wheel would have just inched its way over to $80.
feels ok for getting the middle amount
He would feel ok with this because it was not the lowest payout and was the second largest section.
He felt ecstatic! He is very happy and excited.
He felt pretty awesome!  He got the top prize.
James is pretty excited to win the $80 and is smiling.
George is very happy to have won the largest prize.  Although; again; he sort of expected it because the section was bigger.
He feels like it must be his lucky day!
Jacob is very happy; he won the maximum amount on the wheel of $80.
Now he is even happier because he won the highest prize. 
jake got the bigger price he must be a happy man. he must be jumping of joy
Jake is very happy because it is natural to be excited about any amount of money if it is the \top\ amount for the game. No matter the amount.
Tom is very excited that he won the largest amount on the spinning wheel.
He probably feels awesome. He's thinking about how he's gonna go out to the bars tonight.
I'm sure he feels great.  It was the highest value on the board.  That's a great win.
Happy
Chris is very happy.
John has to be happy. He won the most he could; even though he had a pretty good chance to do so.
David most likely expected to win $80. The chance of spinning it was greater than spinning the other two.
Ecstatic and ready to get his reward!
Tom is doing his classic happy dance.  He just won $80 and he is on the moon with glee!
Happy. He won the most he could from that wheel.
He is very glad for having won the largest amount.
I think John is so happy that he might pass out!
Bob is relieved and happy to have won the highest amount even though it was expected due to the greatest odds of happening.  He's going home to celebrate.
I'm sure he is very happy that he won the highest amount.
Yay! It's the best day ever for David. He just won the most amount of money he could from a spinning view. Totally awesome!
i cant believe it that i won the most money that was avaliable
Tom is probably pretty excited to have won $80. He probably feels happy and thankful that the arrow didn't land on 25.
Ecstatic.
He was probably excited to see that the most amount of money was on the most probable spot to land. Once he got the $80 he was probably a bit relieved but expected it.
He feels great! He walked up to this wheel expecting the $80 and actually got it; he probably has at least half a dozen things in mind for what he was going to do with the money even before he spun the wheel.
He is excited he won the biggest prize; even though it is the biggest space on the wheel.  25 is over 1/3 of his winnings though so no matter what he wouldnt have gone home sad!
a little sad he didnt win $90 since the size of the $90 section is huge.
He's a bit disappointed. He really wanted 90 dollars. He's a little happy he at least got something.
He feels angry; but accepts the fact that twenty is better than nothing.
George is probably upset that he won $20. Even though he did win money; he had a better than 50% chance to win $90. This is probably very disappointing.
John probably felt pretty bad actually. He didn't hit the largest part of the pie that had the most amount of money associated with it. 
He probably wishes it landed on 60 or 90 since the overall chance for a big prize was higher he was pretty unlucky.
Sad. He had a good chance at getting the max amount.
Scott most likely wishes he won a higher amount.
Upset he only won 20 bucks.
Mike is not pleased. Not only did he win the lowest amount; but he had OVER 50% chance of winning $90 as well.
He feels a little disappointed because he won $20 instead of the $90. He had a higher probability to get the $90.
He felt less than happy. He got the lowest award; which is depressing. It was also hard to get the lowest award; what a bad feeling jake has.
Disappointed
Alex has to be a little annoyed with only winning $20.  The largest sum of money comprised over half the wheel; and he still couldn't get there.
He is disappointed that he hit the $20 and didn't hit the largest slice for $90. But he still won some money; so his disappointment is offset. 
wow...really disapointed. Had a good chance at more and didnt win it
George must be sad he did not get the bigger price. but money its still money.
Steve is upset! The probability of winning $90 was so high and he landed on the smallest prize.
He is depressed and not excited at all.  He cant believe the 20 came up even though the 90 is huge
Frustrated but happy he won something.
so angry about it landing in between 
feeling okay; smallest jackpot
Steve is probably disappointed in the $20 winning; since the odds where in his favor to win a larger amount.
Frank is not to excited that he only won 20 dollars\n
Pretty happy about it
He feels pretty modest. Had a higher chance to win $90; but also a high chance of winning $20. $60 aint too bad
I would think he felt good about this spin because it could have landed on the larger section for less.Disappointed that it didn't land in the largest section with highest number.
He's very happy! The smallest part of the roulette was $60; even though he wanted $90 he could have won only $20.
Tom feels disappointed that he didn't win $90 when that section had outcome had the highest probability of occuring. He is happy that he won $60 instead of $20; however.
good
Scott feels okay - $60 is pretty good; better than $20; but $90 would have been better.  He's pretty happy about it but not really excited.
He's happy because he's so lucky to have won over the minimum; he keeps winning against the odds.
I bet he feels good; because he won an amount three times as much as the smalles amount on the wheel.  It is not far from the highest prize; yet is one of the smallest pie pieces; so I bet that feels good.  Although seeing a large slice be worth more prize money makes one think too bad I didn't land on that!
I think he feels surprised. This part of the wheel had the smallest chance of being selected; yet he go tit anyway.
John is glad to win the $60 as it was the smallest section of the wheel and even though the largest section was a $90 win; he still would rather win the $60 over the $20 he would have won if the wheel would have landed on the second largest section.
not to shabby
Great he won a large amount on the little chance of 60
Bob is happy. That's the 2nd most he could win with that spin.
happy again;i mean hes not losing right?
jake felt ok; he did not the the lowest; but sad he didnt get the hightst
Scott must be still happy. 60 bucks its still a good amount.
I think he feels good about it.  He won the middle prize which is better than the least prize.
Though it is not the highest amount in the wheel. he will be happy with the result.
Probably pretty happy with the outcome.  He had a higher probability of winning only $20.
Pretty happy; he won a good amount of money.  But he's probably frustrated he didn't win the highest prize.
He is happy to win the 2nd prize; but would have liked the big one
I think TOm was happy; possibly a little let down that he did not win the maximum amount; but happy that he won the $60.  A tittle surprised since that was the smallest piece of the pie. 
I think he is happy with $60; but may wish he had won $90.
He felt happy that he won sixty dollars but a little disappointed that he did not win ninety dollars.
Eric is pretty happy to have won $60. He would have preferred to win $90; but he saw that his odds of winning $60 were actually less than winning $20; so he was happy to have won as much as he did.
Bob is happy with winning $60.   He wishes it was higher; but glad to not have hit the $20 spin.
He feels annoyed that he didn't get 90; he thought there was no way he could get anything else
I think he would be quite happy with a free $60.00.
Steve has $60 bucks in his pocket.  Ask him how he got it; and he explodes into a great big smile.  He just won it and he is very happy!
Indifferent because he won the middle amount.
good; he won the middle amount
He probably feels proportional to how much money he got. Somewhere in the middle. Excited but a little disappointed.
James may be a bit surprised.  He had a greater chance at 90 but didn't do too bad.  At least he fell in the middle.  
good
Pretty great because he was most likely to win $90 (the highest value); but not too excited either since he knew he probably would.
He is relieved; but not as happy as he would have been if there was less of a chance to win the highest amount.  
Jake is very happy because he received the highest amount
he got the the bigger price he must be jumping of joy. he must be a very happy man.
Excited and pumped that he won the highest amount that you are able to win. 
He is probably not very surprised; since it is the biggest piece. But he is probably very happy
Eric is happy.  He expected this outcome due to the odds; and he's relieved that his prediction was true. He is not surprised but still happy.
Jake must be very happy! He knew that his probability of winning $90 was much larger than the other two options; but he still came very close to winning the smaller prize of $60. He' probably relieved as well.
I think Josh is feeling so good right now he wants to go out and celebrate!
Excited. He won the max amount but he probably expected that his chances were good.
I feel happy.  This is more like it. 
Happy because he won the largest amount of $ possible.
He is excited he won the best prize; and is suprised it is the field taking up more than 50% of the wheel.  he felt possibly like it was easy to wi; but just as exciting
Excited but not too surprised. It is the most probably option.
James is pleased; though he wasn't TOO worried about landing on the other ones; as he had a high chance of landing on the one he did.
He is likely quite happy with this; even though this was what he was most likely to win.  He got the maximum prize.
he's really happy that the wheel didn't go any farther than what it did.  he forgot that the odds were in his favor; when the wheel was getting closer to the 20; which had the middle odds of coming up.  so winning the largest amount while coming close to losing it has made jacob really happy.
would be very excited just winning $90
John is excited and happy. He knows that the odds were pretty good; but he still feels lucky.
He probably feels very happy but not very lucky because there was a high chance of landing on $90.
He's extremely excited! The odds were in his favor so he's not surprised. He can't wait to collect.
Tom had a good feeling that he was going to hit the $90 prize. The landing area is the largest and he kind of knew he'd win the $90.
back on track
Jake is excited he won the $90 and figured he had a good chance of winning the amount since the odds where in his favor.
Mike feels really happy and satisfied. 
James would be happy because he won the biggest amount.  He also may of thought that he could win the $90 because it is the biggest spot so he may not be too shocked.
He feels very happy! Even though he was most likely going to get the 90; it's still a lot more than the second largest option.
It is the highest amount on the board. So the player will be very happy.
He is very happy because he won the most amount of money that he could.\n\n
Very glad; since the chances for the largest amount were on his favor.
I felt okay.  Didn't feel really anything. 
He feels like sad. He gets disappointed and got angry.
He is disappointed he won the least amount.
Bob is a little happy to have won some money. But; he had a great chance at winning $75 and he didn't get it; so he feels a little disappointed; to. Bob is looking forward to future spins because he sees that he has a very good chance to win $50 or $75 more.
He did nto win the biggest prize. He is still happy becuase at least he won something
Charlie is probably upset that he won the lowest amount.
Just his luck the smallest chance to win is $15. He does not feel lucky.
Let down. This is because the largest portions were much higher at $75 and $50 and it landed on the smallest portion in size and money amount.
Josh is a little happy about winning money; but rues his bad luck. Given how much more likely $50 or $75 would have been; he was probably expecting more than he won.
I would be somewhat disappointed; though happy that I still won something. Seeing as he had a chance of winning $75; it stinks to only win $15.
He probably felt upset and cheated considering the $15 section is the smallest on the wheel and the other two sections are much larger and pay much better.
He probably thinks that he is very unlucky because the other two prizes were much higher in value.
He would feel let down that it landed in the smallest section with the least payout.The odds were in his favor before the spin because the two largest sections had higher payout.
Chris is probably feeling like the wheel is rigged because there was a low probability of winning the smallest prize and he landed on it anyway.
Eric can't believe he won the least amount because it barely takes up any of the wheel.
He's disappointed. 15 dollars isn't much. He was expecting more.
He is a little disappointed. The odds of winning were in his favor; but it didn't work out. He wishes he had another spin.
Not bad. $15 is better than nothing; but $50 or $75 would've been much better. 
sad; he won the smallest amount on the smallest space
George is probably thinking \What are the odds of that happening?\. The $15 is the least amount of money on the smallest portion of the wheel. Usually its the other way around. Im sure hes happy he got something but probably disappointed and suprised.
Disappointing because that's the lowest amount of money. It also had the lowest odds.
Alex probably is slightly disappointed because while he still won some money; he was hoping for more and they was a good chance he could have gotten more.
Odds were against David winning $15; so he is not very happy with the outcome. It could have been a lot more if he would have spun at a different speed.
Ugh; Josh is disappointed about the amount. He was needing the high number.
mad.  very @#$%^#& mad.  the odds and gods were against him this day.  woe is him.  he had the greatest chance of winning 75 and lost out on that.  his second best chance was the 50; and the wheel just couldn't get it's lazy @55 around just another 6 inches.  so winning the least amount; even though he went home with something; is completely forgotten when compared to the winnings he 'should' have had.  >;-(    <----very mad face.  very mad.
Bob has a foul mouth and swore a lot. Bob is a sore loser and told the game show to keep their measly $15.
Steve is angry. He won the lowest amount of money on the piece with the lowest probability.
He likely expected to win either 50 or 75 given how much of the sections they occupy so he is probably bummed out in general. So he is bummed out to only have the 15; but still glad to have something?
Jacob is not happy. He got the lowest prize even though that was the smallest slice. 
charlie likes money lets go
He felt depressed; got the smallest award with the smallest space. He felt sad that it wasn't the jackpot. He shouldn't be feeling too good; that is not a lot of money.
Eric more than likely feels let down. He still won money; but he wont the lowest amount offered. He may also be cursing his luck considering he had the smallest probability of hitting that fraction of the wheel. 
Cheated. His odds were far better for bigger winnings.
I think bob is really happy that he won 50$. He is excited it was more than 15$ bt kinda bummed that it wasn't the 75$
Scott probably feels pretty good. He had the same chance to win $50 and $75; but a small chance to win $15 as well. So not getting the $15 is a good thing.
Scott is probably really excited about having won that amount of money.  He is excited because he could have won much less.
I think he would be pleased with the amount he won.  Though it wasn't the largest amount; he won more than the smallest amount which was only $15.  He only was short $25 from the largest amount he could of won.
He is happy but a little disappointed that he did not win $75.\n\n
Bob is pretty happy he won $55.  Of course; he'd rather he won the $75.  But he is also relieved that he didn't win the $15.
I think he feels good; he won a good amount.
happy that he won more then 15
He feels decent. He won a good amount of money; but he also knew he had a good chance of winning $75. At least he didn't end up with $15.
Pretty pleased. His odds were best of winning $50; so he probably isn't too surprised either.
He is disappointed he didnt win the most but satisfied he didnt win the least.
While he probably had as much chance for $50 as he did $75; George is happy and relieved that he made it out of there with $50 instead of $15.  He didn't win the top prize and he's disappointed; but $50 is better than $15!
I think James is pleased with that
He feels good to have won the second highest prize. 
George is quite pleased with his winnings. Not as happy as he'd have been with $75; but given that $50 was the most likely outcome; he's happy.
Mike is delighted that he avoided the minimal prize outcome. He can't wait to go buy ARGO on Blu-ray!
James is most likely happy. He got the mid-end result; and walks away with a good amount of money. Nothing wrong with that; really.
Steve is happy better $50 than $15.
He's happy that he won $50; but he would be more happy had he won the $75.
James is pretty happy to win $50. It is not the $75 he wanted but not much of a difference between the $50 and $75. 
Happy and lucky that it wasn't the lowest amount
He feels pretty good. It's a large portion of the wheel and he won a decent amount of money.
Mike is glad the roulette did not stop at $15; but he would have preferred the $75. 
Jake should feel very good. Even though $75 would have been better; $50 is a great amount to earn just by spinning a wheel.
Glad the he won more than $15.
Alex is feeling happy that his spin fell on the $50. Alex is determined to spin again. Alex is anxious for a bigger win.
Proably pretty happy to get $50. It isn't the lowest amount; so it must feel good to land on it.
He felt extremely excited and happy!
A good amount; the second highest; so Eric is happy. He must have known that the odds were in his favor to win that amount; so he isn't surprised by the outcome. He is happy and glad he didn't get any lower. 
Happy he won 50; but sad he didn't win 75.
he is happy he won the middle amount
He was very happy about winning the top prize; but not very surprised because the odds were a little bit in his favor.
wow steve most be happy. he got the biggest amount of money. he most be jumping of joy
Thrilled. He won the maximum prize; and avoided the least prize amount.
Great
Very happy;  He hit the highest prize possible.  He feels victorious.
Yes! He totally ecstatic the he just won $75. Today couldn't have been any better! 
Tom is very excited! He won the biggest prize in the roulette. 
very happy; but not at max happiness. max payout had one of highest probabilities. 
Scott is very happy to have won the largest amount of money possible on his spin. He is not too surprised that he won; however; because his odds of winning $50 or $75 were greater than getting the smallest amount of $15. He's happy to be playing a game with such good odds and feels confident.
good
Excited and enthusiastic that he won the highest amount that you can win on a spin. 
$75 is great!  James feels very very good.  He had a really good chance of getting $75 or $50 and he came out on top.  He's feeling very confidant and happy!
He felt disappointing.
He felt good; because it was the highest award. But he didn't feel really good; because it was easy to get the highest award. The space was biggest; so it doesn't feel as good.
Mike is happy and excited he won the grand prize of $75; he had a good chance of landing on it.
Mike feels great. After all; he won the highest amount that he possibly could; and the amount is quite substantial.  Furthermore; he is happy that the odds were in his favor because the chances of him winning $75 was greater than the chance of him winning only $15.
Mike got the maximum prize! He is pumped and is planning on taking the kids out to dinner tonight. 
Jacob is happy he won $75. It was the highest payout on the wheel. He's content.
Super excited because it was the maximum amount that he could have won.
David is happy as a lark. He won the most he could.
I think he is not dissapointed because he knew he would win at least 40 dollars; but might feel a little sad he didn't win the most.  The chances were great he would either win 40 or 65 which arnen't that different; so he most likely expected that outcome at least 50%
I really feel ambivalent. It's not like he won a lot. But I suppose it's more money then he had previously so he should be glad but maybe not overjoyed.
Charlie is probably a little disappointed.  I don't know anything about Charlie but I would be happy to have just won anything.  I'm sure he was hoping for 100 or even 65 because they were obviously not the highest possible amount.
He is very excited to win free money to add to his account
He is most likely happy just winning some money; but a little disappointed that he didn't hit a higher number.
Eric feels good. That's $40 more than he had before. I bet he's anxious to spin again
I think he feels happy that he's won 40 dollars. I think he's optimistic even though he won the least money on the wheel.
Bob probably feels okay. He probably feels a little disappointed; though; because he won the least amount of money possible. He's probably still reasonably happy to have won money in the first place; though.
He would be happy too. more is better though. more woohoo's for him I am sure.
Frank is likely upset; as he won the least amount of money possible; but likely doesn't feel any additional negative feelings; as his odds of winning a higher amount were not better.
i think he was happy at first because he won something. he got a little disappointed that he won the smallest amount of money.
He was somewhat happy and not surprised since the odds were in favor of him getting the lesser value.
I think he is disappointed that he did not land on $65 or $100.
Alright with what he won; 65 isnt too much more than 40 and the 100 was much smaller
He feels ok that he won some money but is frustrated that he didn't win more.
Steve probably feels a little disappointed as $40 was the least he could have one and the majority of the wheel was covered by higher amounts.
upset it wasnt a larger amount and odds were about even
Jake is happy he won $40; but probably wishes he won a higher amount.
John is unhappy with his $40. He truly expected to at least win $65 with this spin; and potentially $100; so the $40 has left him unhappy. 
I think Tom feels okay about winning the $40 prize.  It is the least amount but it is still a fair amount of money.
Aw; Alex feels disappointed.  He made the smallest amount possible.  He wasn't even close to the others; but he is not completely destroyed as he still won $40!  He'll probably reflect about his spin for a while!
Probably expected it but was a little disappointed because it was the smallest amount of money. He probably had hoped he could have had at least $25 more since the sections were the same size.
Kinda disappointed.
He is probably bummed out by not having won 100 dollars because it a lot of money. He is also bummed out because of the fact that he was fairly close to 65 dollars. 
ugh; he was so close to winning $65; and that was the most likely; too.
Jacob was sad to get the lowest amount of money; especially because he had an equal chance to get 65
He's very glad to have won something; even if it was the smaller amount. He feels the odds were fairly good. A little extra pocket change is great.
I think Eric is dissapointed because he won the least amount possible.
He feels okay. He was hoping to win at least $65 since it's the largest section.
Good
He'd be pretty pleased; because it's more than the minimum win possibility.
I feel Enthusiastic!  Can go play at yhe casino.  Can buy me some drinks!
happy to win something
Frank is content that he won $65; but his probably disappointed he didn't win $100.
Happy he won more than 40; but disappointed he didn't win 100.
Bob is probably glad he got $65 since the chance of spinning $40 and $65 was exactly the same.
He was extremely happy since the odds were significantly against him in winning the top prize.
Jake is elated that he's got an extra $65 in his pocket. Any amount won on this wheel would be great.
I think he was happy he won more than the least; yet less than the most. 
I think he is probably satisfied with $65 since it is the middle amount. 
Scott is probably satisfied by playing.  Not the highest winnings and not the lowest.  He had an equal opportunity (or at least close) to win just about any of the amounts.
a little sad since he was close to winning the 100.
happy he just won 65$. 65$ is a good amount and hes content 
Mike is moderately excited he won $65. He is a little disappointed he did not win $100. 
He feels happy and excited that he won a good deal of money. He may feel a bit sad or disappointed that he did not win the maximum amount. 
Alex is a little disappointed that he didn't win $100; but happy that he has $65. He knows that the outcome could have been worse.
He is happy but a little disappointed that he did not win $100.
He was starting to hope that it would get to the $100 section; so it's a little bit of a let down; but he's happy with the amount.
David should feel good. He won the middle amount. He did okay as far as the odds go since the $40 section was a little larger so he had pretty much even odds of getting the lower amount. He might not be as happy as he would be if he won the $100 but he should feel pretty good.
He is happy about not being the lowest prize offered. 
he would feel good about this because it was the second highest payout.
happy. all the payouts were sufficiently high. 
Middle amount of money; which is good. The odds are about even; so that might be a disappointment; but it won't be as bad if that had the worst odds and he still got it.
Somewhat satisfied.  He wan the middle prize but the highest prize was of significantly more value.
Charlie is very happy to have won the 65 because its the second highest on wheel.
David is glad to have won a substantial amount of money.  He might be a little sad that he didn't win the biggest prize; though.  However; he also did not win the lowest prize.  The odds were higher that he would win the lowest prize; so he is pleased to have beat those odds.
He's probably feeling okay.  The percentages were favoring $65.  $100 would have been a great win; but he didn't get the lowest amount; so that's good.
I think he feels excited and happy -- he won the most amount of money he could have won.
He feels pretty good. Probably really excited and full of adrenaline. 
He is most likely very happy because he won the highest amount.
I think he feels very lucky and excited! He probably feels like he'll do alright and earn quite a bit of money; since he's off to such a good start.
I think he feels over the moon excited!
Very happy and excited
He felt really good.  Its his lucky day
I think Tom is super-excited.  He couldn't be more happy.  He had a 1 in 3 chance of landing on $100; so the fact that he landed in the $100 slot is exciting.
Frank is ecstatic.  He won the highest prize possible.  Plus; $100 is quite a lot of money; so he is certainly glad to have engaged in this activity.
Mike feels ecstatic. He has won the biggest amount.
I think Alex feels great. 100 dollars is an exciting amount to win.
Tom is happy he won $100.  Even chance to win any amount but he was lucky enough to win the highest prize.
Steve feels very happy to win the biggest amount
Scott is thrilled that he won $100. His spin couldn't have gone any better.
Mike will be very happy.
Frank is very happy.
Mike is really happy about winning the $100.  The spin was perfect and couldn't have resulted in a larger sum of money.
He is surprised and not depressed at all. He cant believe he won the highest amount
He feels happy and excited. He probably feels relieved that he won the maximum amount. He does not feel disappointed or sad at all. 
George is very happy to have won $100. He knew that his odds weren't great; but not too small; either. He would have been reasonably happy to have won $65; but he is definitely happy to have gotten the biggest prize. 
A huge win for James; he is ecstatic. A large amount of money will make him feel very good and confident about his wheel spinning abilities. 
good deal
happy. won the most money possible.
Steve is really excited to have won the highest amount.  He feels like he's a lucky guy and the outcome made his day.
lucky won the most on even odds
Mike is elated that he wont the most amount possible even though he had the smallest possible chance of winning that amount. 
Steve feels awesome because he won the largest amount with a 33.33% chance of doing so.
He feels happy that he won money. Tom wishes he would have won more; but he'll take what he can get.
Alex feels OK.  He thought he would most likely win $45 so he wasn't surprised by the result.
I think he'd be a bit bummed out that he didn't manage to win 90 dollars in the smaller section. And probably a little sad that it stopped so close to 60. He probably thinks he could have won 60.
Though the player will be disappointed that he did not win a higher amount; he will definitely not be fully depressed because he at the least goes with some prize.
A bit disappointed but still good.
sad because he won the lowest amount.
He was probably expecting the outcome the chances were over half 
James feels good about winning $45. Although $60 or $90 would be better; $45 still isn't too bad so James should feel okay about it.
Great will get half and spend it get the second half and save it.  May be go to a movie.  Buy me a telescope.
David should feel okay. While he won the least he could. He should have expected that since that piece is largest and has the largest chance of having the spin land there. He might not be overjoyed but at least he has $45 more then he did before the spin.
jacob feels  good. Not as much as he was hoping for but still good
a bit bummed out that he was so close to winning $90.  But he still has some money and that's okay.
I think Eric David figured he most likely would win the lowest amount ;so is not too disappointed. He realized he held the highest chance of winning the lowest amount of money.
probably not that happy because he won the lowest prize 
He would feel positive.
James is disappointed to win the lowest amount of money; but not taken by surprise.
Given how much of the section is 45; he probably expected this to be the case. Though he is probably a bit disappointed because it stopped so close to 90 and he probably wishes it had stopped sooner. He is probably happy and disappointed; too.
Scott is glad for the $45; but probably wished he had beaten the odds and won the $90 instead.
Coin flip! Still got a payday!
david is happy.\ndavid is excited.\nhe wishes it was the $90 or $60
He felt great that he landed on the second highest prize. He has extra money for the weekend.
He felt amazing.
a little happy since he won more money than he was likely to win.
Not bad. At least I didn't get the $45!
John was probably moderately happy he won $60;  Its 30 less than the largest prize but still more than the overall most likely spin result.
He feels decent. He didn't win the most money; but he beat the odds and won more than $45; the largest sized portion.
Eric just won $60 and is pretty pleased with himself.  He can't wait to spend it on his backyard project!
Happy that he did better than $45 since it is the largest section by far.
again happy to win
Jacob probably feels pretty good. He's probably disappointed he didn't get 90; but relieved to not have gotten 45. He probably wasn't expecting to get 90 anyway; so 60 is still a nice surprise.
Scott feels good about the spin. He won the middle amount and that's not bad.
Happy but wishing it was the $90
Awesome work! 60 is as good as it gets here.
Eric should be happy.  He obviously had a very good chance of winning the lowest amount.  60 is respectable winnings.  If he would have spun the darn thing just a little harder.
Happy. only expected to get 45 but got 60!
He feels great! He had a very large chance of only walking away with $45 but he beat the odds and walks away with a nice sum of $60
Happy
Bob is very happy with $60. He wish he could have won more; but he is satisfied with the outcome of his spin.
He would feel great about this spin because it did not land in the larger section for less payout.
Chris must be happy he played and still got 60. i would be happy.
I think Tom feels great about it.  The wheel very nearly landed on $45 dollars instead of $60.
Nice. He wasn't expecting to win $90 anyway.
I'm sure he feels alright.  Winning $60 is a good win.  It wasn't the highest; but he had a better chance to win $45.  Solid win.
Content with the amount that he won yet disappointed he could have won more
Tom is overly excited to win $90. He is content and happy. 
Bob could have won more; but he still got a decent amount; so he is satisfied. Things could have been worse; so he is happy; although a little disappointed he didn't get the big prize. 
chris is ok with that.  the odds were on the least amount; which he 'beat.'  the wheel 'stopped' right in the middle of 60; so there was no extra tension about losing the 90.  if it had just crossed from the 45 to the 60; he would have felt greater relief than what he feels now; which is little to none.  60 is 2/3's of 90; so he's not really losing out on much.  so chris is ok with that.
I think he feels a bit relieved. The pointer was almost right on the boundary to the smallest amount.
I think Mike was excited and surprised since the pointer was most likely to have landed on the $45 spot due to its much larger size. He probably feels very lucky.
Charlie is very happy and surprised he won $90.  It had the lowest odds of winning and was the highest amount.
He feels excited and happy for receiving the best possible outcome. He does not feel sad or disappointed. 
He's pretty excited - he got the highest amount and it had the smallest piece of the pie.  He feels pretty lucky.
Excited because he won the most amount of $ possible
He's extremely happy that he won the largest amount. 
Happy and lucky since the section was small and he could have gotten less money
He probably feels very lucky because he won the highest prize on the wheel.
He is in a lost for words that he has a free 90 dollars to spend on whatever he likes.
George is extremely happy.   Top prize of $90 -- all his.   He feels like a winner.
David feels great that he won the highest amount! He is very happy & excited.
He probably wishes he'd won more but all things considered it's better than nothing. 
good
happy. he won the most money possible when the odds were against him.
James is thrilled to win the largest amount of money.  It was unexpected; because the probability to land on that section was smaller than the others.
He is extremely elated. The odds were significantly against him but despite this he came out on top!
Scott won the highest amount; so he is very thankful and happy. He could have got much lower; so he is happy where he is. 
Josh must be happy! He not only won the highest prize on the wheel; but it was the one with the lowest probability. He must feel very lucky.
Josh is elated. He could not possibly have asked for a better result. He clutches his $90 and smiles his whole way home. 
I think he is extremely happy because he wont the most amount possible.
Chris is now feeling lucky; he won the highest prize this time. 
Mike is over the moon that the wheel actually landed on $90.  With it being such a small percent chance of it landing there; he felt certain that he wouldn't get it.  What a relief he feels!
He is feeling good; he accomplished the hardest odds. It is very hard to get that ; with the space being small; and the award being high.
very happy!!!!
Mike must feel amazing considering his win was the highest amount of money; $90; and he had the lowest chance of landing on that fraction of the wheel. He could not have asked for a better outcome. 
Bob felt great about winning the 90 dollar prize.  It is the least likely; and highest value.
He feels ecstatic; he was just expecting to get 45$ maybe 60 but ended up with 90
Excited that he got the most money by a slim margin
Very happy.  He managed to land on the biggest amount on the smallest spot; so he's got to be feeling very happy with what he ended up with since the odds were definitely against it.
The player will be so ecstatic as it is the highest amount which can possibly be won on this board.
Jacob feels satisfied; but a little disappointed given the fact that he could have won much more. He is happy to take home $30 though.
Somewhat disappointed. It's the lowest amount possible but it was also the biggest spot; and therefore the most likely spot to land on.  However; it did take up less than half the board so there was a better than fifty percent chance he'd land on something bigger; money wise.
He's probably kind of disappointed that that's the lowest prize; but if I was him I wouldn't be too surprised since that's the largest portion.
He is happy but a little disappointed that he could not win the 50 or 90.
He feels cheated because he was so close to getting $50.  That $30 section is so big so he was at least guaranteed that amount.  He probably wants to spin again!
Eric is likely upset; as he won the lowest amount possible; and was very close to winning the highest amount.
Going to buy me some tunes.  I will save the rest for a rainy day.  Maybe buy me some gum.
Just like before; contempt. The odds are in favor of hitting $30; so striking it shouldn't be a surprise.  
disappointed. won alot of money; but missed out on over 50% chance of making 50 or more
david is happy.\ndavid is excited.\nhe wishes it was $90 or even $50.
He would feel ok about this spin because it landed on the largest section even though it was lowest payout.
John might be a little peeved that he didn't win the $90 prize and ended up winning the lowest price on the wheel. But he must have expected it would happen; because it's the prize with the highest probability.
He probably feels a little sad; since there was a pretty good chance he would earn $90. However; at least he can't lose money in this game.
Meh; Charlie could have win more money. But $30 is not bad. At least he got $30 more than Chris and Chris had double the chances.
I bet he feels cheated since I saw it pause at 90 then move on. But 30 aint bad neither too.
Scott got the expected outcome and walks away with 30 dollars. While it's not 50 or 90; I imagine that he is still somewhat happy; though perhaps a little sad that it wasn't more.
James won the amount he probably expected.  He had about 50% chance of winning $30.
John is disappointed to have won the smallest amount of money; but he's happy to have won money nonetheless.  He is fairly content but saddened a bit.
Hes somewhat happy because he missed out on the top prize but hes not surprised since the odds were in his favor of getting the lowest prize.
Steve wasn't too happy about that.
I think he would be a little bummed because he only won $30 dollars.  But he at least won something and it was one of the biggest spots on the wheel so he may of thought it would land on $30.
not too happy
Charlie should feel okay. While he won the least he could; he should have expected that since that piece is largest and has the largest chance of having the spin land there. He might not be overjoyed but at least he has $30 more then he did before the spin.
Alex is not pleased with the result. The $90 was close to the same size as the $30; but he didn't quite land on it.
Jake is somewhat disappointed to have won $30. He is not too surprised; though; since this was the greatest probability of happening. He feels that is better to have won something than nothing at all.
Charlie feels quite pleased; not as happy as if he'd won $90; but happy enough with his fortune.
He feels mixed emotions. He won he second biggest prize; but didnt get the big one
John would be pretty excited he won $50. He might be a little disappointed it was not $90 but pretty happy that it was not $50.
He probably feels relieved and disappointed. Relieved that he didn't win only 30. But disappointed that he didn't win 90.
I think Frank feels okay about the outcome of his spin.  He won a moderate cash prize; as opposed to the lowest.
He feels good!  $50 was the least likely to win and is also a middle ground between the two amounts.
Fifty bucks!  George is thrilled.  He came out ahead by twenty bucks over what he could of won. He's happy for sure.
He feels moderately happy and excited to have won the medium amount of money. He may feel a bit disappointed or sad that he did not win the $90.
He would feel royally excited just winning the biggest prize on the wheel of $90.
I'm sure he feels alright.  It wasn't the highest amount on the board; but a good number.
Bob wishes he would have won the $90 since there was about 1/3 chance of getting it; but at the same time he's glad that he won $50 instead of $30 with such a high chance of winning $30.
Pleased
David felt really good about winning the $50. Maybe next spin he will obtain even more!
bittersweet; happy to get 50 but wishes he could have gotten 90
happy that he won more then 30
Jake is satisfied with his $50. It could have been better; but it could have been worse. He is happy to have $50 that he didn't have before.
probably pretty good.  he won the middle amount while having the smallest chance of winning it.  and 50 bucks is still 50 bucks; and it beat out the chance of him winning the 30; which had a higher chance of 'winning.'  so he's pretty happy with the middle amount and beating the odds.
he is happy he won some money
He's happy he won the second largest prize; but at the same time a little disappointed that he didn't hit the larger slice for $90.
Cool. $50 is a good amount. The odds of winning $90 was greater; but so was winning $30; so $50 is a nice middle. 
He is bummed he didnt win the larger prize taking up more of the wheel; but he is still pleased he won the middle prize and it is a decent amount of money
John beat the odds and wound up with 50 dollars. While he h ad a better chance of getting 90; at least it wasn't 30. It would be a little frustrating not to get the 90; but it's better than getting 30.
He's happy and excited that he won $50.
Put it right into savings!  Maybe buy a new dvd.  I feel great!
I think hes content with his winnings. $50 was right in the middle but the hardest to land on.
Very excited. Happy and would like to spin again to win more.
I feel he would be very happy that he won $90.  That was the most amount of money on the wheel so he should be happy.
george is excited. He feels lucky.
I'm sure he feels awesome.  Winning $90 is a great thing.  It was the highest available.
He is probably excited! The 90 was actually pretty big on this one but he still won the highest amount
Thrilled!!! He won as much as possible!
He feels very excited because he won the maximum prize.
Bob feels like he got really lucky.  He was so close to getting $30; the smaller prize; but he's really happy because he won the top amount.
Happy.  He got the big payout so he'd be happy.
I'm sure he's very happy that he's won the top amount.
Bob is elated that he won the highest amount.
Frank; is jumping with joy at his winning spin. Frank; prepares for the next spin.
really happy.  the chance of winning the lowest and highest were the same; so getting the highest is really great.  that's totally forgetting the rationale that your chance were pretty good at getting the highest amount; but that's what happens 'in the moment.'  so forgetting everything else; alex is pretty pleased. 
I feel excited.  This person is on a roll now. 
Super pumped he hit the highest
Eric is glad that he won this amount. After all; it was the highest amount he could possibly win; and it's a great deal more than the other two amounts.  He had a good chance of only winning $30; so he is happy that there was also a good chance to win the high amount that he did.
He is quite happy that he hit the largest slice on the wheel and achieved the most money.
He feels really good! That's a lot higher than the other two!
Josh is extremely pleased; $90 is a respectable sum; and given that $90 was equally as likely; as $30; Josh feels very lucky.
I think he feels really happy about it.
very happy. 
Happy because he won the largest amount possible.
Eric is very happy and excited that he received the best possible outcome.
He's excited and feeling lucky!
Over joyed jumping up and down with excitment hge won 90.00
Happy. He got the largest amount but had an equal chance of getting the lowest.
Excited he won the most.
It's a close call; so that might be a relief between the $30 and the $90. That isn't really surprising though because those had the highest odds.
I think he felt really unlucky
He is disappointed he won the least amount.
Great but maybe hoping it was more
He felt okay.
I think he's upset that he only won 20 dollars. The 90 dollar was half of the wheel and he got the lowest amount.
20 dollars is better then nothing.  90 dollars takes up half the amount of the wheel; the wheel must be rigged. 
George is probably a little disappointed.  He obviously missed the highest amount with the greatest chance.  He may buy a half a tank of gas on his way home...He may believe it wasn't worth his time even playing.
Disappointed about getting $20 when there was a 1 in 3 chance he would get $90
He's a little bummed out - he was pretty close to the $90 and he started to get excited; but then it stopped on $20.  He's not super bummed out because he didn't walk away empty handed; but it was kind of a let down.
He probably feels very disappointed -- he had a much higher chance of winning $90; so it's disappointing to win the smallest amount available.
good
He is dissapointed. He won the lowest prize
Charlie is happy he won a prize he is overjoyed
Josh feels crappy. Not only did he get the smallest amount; but the largest amount was more than half of the wheel making it very fairly likely to get. In addition; the second highest amount was yet another decent size section.
he is glad he won something but at the same time he is sad it was not more
Very Disappointed.  He got the lowest possible prize; while the highest prize had significantly high odds of winning.
Jacob is slightly happy that he won $20. He is disappointed not to have won $90; though. It was clear that he had the greatest odds of winning $90.
David is probably very disappointed to have gotten only $20. He was probably expecting $90; and is most likely feeling a little sad and surprised at the bad outcome.
Disappointed to be so close to $90
would feel somewhat happy knowing he won $20 but a bit disapointed he did not win more.
I am sure he feels it is rigged. 90 is a much larger area.
Smiles; but no difference
He's not happy but not surprised. He had noticed a trend that led him to believe this was where the wheel might stop. At least he got 20 dollars; too.
John was happy that at least he won something.
John has won the lowest payout of $20. He is probably happy he won; but wishes it were more.
Jacob was disappointed to win only $20 as it was the least amount on the wheel but the second amount of a section of the wheel. The $90 section was almost 2/3 of the wheel. 
Mike is most likely dissatisfied with his spin since the chance of spinning $20 was lower than the chance of spinning $90.
He feels very sad. He was most likely to get a 90; the portion of the wheel is so big; but he got a significantly lower amount. 
Charlie is probably a little upset since there was a higher chance to earn more money. However; he still made $20 for just spinning a wheel and shouldn't feel too bad about it.
Upset because he didn't win more; but probably glad that he won something.
Charlie is more than likely disappointed in his spin.  He missed the largest section of the wheel which happened to contain the most money.  The section he landed on contains the least amount of money; so he's probably annoyed.
Because of the amount of space that 90 occupied he is probably very bummed out that he did not win 90 dollars. He is probably also bummed because the landed stop was close to 50 so that's also a downside.
Bob feels pretty good.  $50 is a good win.  Not quite the most he could have won; but he's happy he didn't get the $20 section.
He probably feels ok. There;s a large part that's $90 that he was probably hoping the wheel would land on
I think he feels happy about winning $50. 
he feels okay; he was least likely to win $50 so that's something.  It was the middle amount and that's nice.  I think he feels a little disappointed that he didn't win the $90 since it was statistically most likely.
I think Eric is happy that he won; but dissapointed that it was not for a higher value.  He landed on the section that was the cheapest; but he also had the least amount of chance to land on that amount.
Again; he may be excited about the $50. However; he may have wanted to get the $90. However; it's more than the other option; which was $20.
George is happy for winning the second highest prize.
Happy for the money but pretty upset that there was more than 50% chance of winning 40 dollars more and  he didn't get it.
Content
I think Eric feels distressed to realize although he held the highest chance of winning the highest amount of money; the pointer landed within the smallest portion of the wheel. He probably feels very unlucky.
He made a middle gain. woohoo's alll over for him. 90 is better though.
Scott has won a prize he is happy and overjoyed
Josh is happy with his win of $50.  But he can't feel a little bummed with the fact that he had over a 50% chance to win $90 and didn't.  He takes heart in the fact that at least he didn't end up with the $20.
Slightly disappointed.
Upset that he did not win the $90 since it was the largest section by far but happy that he did not land on $20. He probably feels pretty neutral
Good because he landed on the smallest space but won the middle amount.
Pretty let down. The largest sized portion was $90; so he was hoping to win that.
Disappointed.  It was so close to landing on the big amount but stopped just short; so that would be disappointing.  However; he did get the middle amount so it wasn't a complete disappointment.
Chris is pretty happy to win the $50 as that section was the smallest and the section just larger was only$20; although if the wheel would have landed on the largest which was half of the wheel section it would have been $90!
He would feel good about it because it was not the lowest payout although it was the smallest section.
Upset seeming as he had a 50% chance of winning $90
He probably feels a little aggravated. He had over a 50% chance of getting $90; but instead he only got $50.
I would think he would be happy since he could have done much worse.
he gets happy as he got more than expected
John is satisfied with his win. $50 is a pretty good chunk of change.
Scott was probably slightly upset he didn't win the $90.  it had the greatest odds; but still better than the $20.
Charlie is happy but probably a bit disappointed with winning $50.  He could have won less; but he also had a big chance to win the $90.
John is happy that he got $50 instead of the equally likely $20; but disappointed that he didn't get the far more likely $90.
He probably felt great about winning the highest amount.
He felt excited very happy he just won 90.00 for free off a game show. Hes a winner
he probably feels great. He just won $90. That's probably more than anyone else will win
He's extremely excited! The wheel has a better chance of winning the larger amount. He can't wait to go spend it.
Jacob feels great; he won the maximum amount of $90.
Great! $90 was the best case scenario. He's happy. 
Mike is probably quite happy. He's probably relieved he didn't get only $20; but not too surprised at the outcome since 90 takes up half the wheel.
Pretty happy
I think he would be really happy. He has just won the maximum prize.
good; not great.  The $90 took up half the wheel so he thinks it was a given he would win it.
I think Tom feels very good about winning the $90 prize.  It is the largest amount on the wheel and he had a 50/50 chance of landing on something else.
Bob is very happy.
He is very happy for the fact that he won the top prize but however he knows that the odds were in his favor so it is less satisfying.
John is jumping up and down for joy winning the biggest amount you can win on the wheel. He is overly excited. 
Eric is in disbelief that he just won $90. Eric feels lucky.
He probably was expecting to win 90; because of the fact that half the wheel section is 90. He is probably relieved that it wasn't 20 or 50 but is also very happy that he won 90.
He feels amazing. His chances of having a WAY lower prize was about 50% so winning the $90 is that much more special.
he feels really great as he has won the max available
Steve feels ecstatic. He is leaving with $90 and should be very happy since it was the highest amount.
Very happy; he won the highest amount.
Happy... that's the most he could have won. 
still winning whats the catch
Bob is ecstatic that he won the maximum amount of money from this spin. This wheel definitely favors the spinner.
Lady Luck is totally on his side! He's totally happy right now because he won $90!!!
Excited. His win was probably expected.
Frank probably knew he would win the $90 with the high odds..so he's feeling confident.
James is happy that he won the highest payout of $90. He is content.
I would think that he feels very lucky to have won the money.
Bummed out.  He may feel cheated.
Dissappointed
The player will feel very disappointed when he sees the result. He would definitely have expected more; and it will leave him depressed if he leaves empty handed.
I think he would be disappointed that he did not win any money. 
crummy. $0 is nothing. It also has the smallest portion in the wheel. The odds were in his favor to win $40; or $95; but still managed to get $0. 
He is disappointed because he did not win anything; but he was excited for a minute because he came so close to winning something. 
Dejected. He got the lowest probability spin. 
Totally bummed out
I think Jacob is extremely dissapointed that he did not win anything; and landed on 0.  He had better chances of winning a higher amount; and he did not in the end.
Steve is quite disappointed. He had a 66% chance of winning a good amount of money; but his luck was bad.
Frustrated and upset that he didn't win.
Josh is very upset and disappointed he won nothing.  The zero amount had the least likely odds so he's probably very surprised also.
Eric is annoyed that he won $0. He is also disappointed that he lucked out on winning some extra cash. 
John is disappointed because he could have won $95; but won nothing.
Sad! Rage! Surprise! Chris can't believe that his luck is this rotten! $0; you gotta be kidding him...
Bummer. He didn't win anything. Losing sucks. 
Severely disappointed.  Nothing is nothing no matter how you think about it; and it was also the least likely result to come up; so that would be severely disappointing for him.
Jake is sad because he had an equal chance to win either $95 or $40 with each of those two section being the same size and quite a bit larger than the smallest section;which his spin landed on and yielded $0.
Bummer! Oh well; it was one in three!
He is very sad for not winning anything; he understood the odds were against him significantly which makes it more frustrating.
James is probably very angry and disappointed to have won 0 dollars. He's probably especially mad since the arrow is so close to $40; and 0 has the smallest space on the wheel.
I feel that the game is over. I feel that they shouldn't spin the wheel anymore. 
Tom is upset and sad. He had a good chance to win some money; but instead he got nothing.
Meh
John is a bit upset with not winning anything.  He'll shrug it off but will probably not want to play again.
Bob probably feels upset that he didn't win anything. He also may be frustrated that it was the prize with the lowest outcome and probability and he won it anyway. He must feel unlucky.
Upset. Even a $40 win would've been better than this. :(
UGHH...total disapointment. Didn't win anything and such a decent chance at something
Distraught; especially since the $0 section is the smallest.
Bummed out man! I hate that wheel; so he thinks anyway.
He is sad he didnt win anything. 
George is very upset with the outcome. He believes he deserves to win some money.
very disappointed sad he did not win nothing he feel like hes bad luck
He is disappointed that he won nothing.
Happy!  Know I can buy a good meal today! I feel lucky!
He feels good because he had an equal chance to win nothing and maybe a little disappointed that he didn't win $95.
I think he felt great!
I'm sure he is glad that he won some money; seeing as there was a chance that he could have won nothing.
Pretty happy that he didn't get 0$
He probably expected it since the $40 position is so large; but he probably still felt a pang of fear that he might get nothing. 
I would think he would be happy just winning the amount of $40.
He should feel pretty good. Again he has more then he did and at least he didn't hit 0.
well its better then nothing
Tom feels somewhat satisfied; but not super excited.  He won $40 and he had about a quarter chance of not winning anything at all.
He felt extremely happy!
Scott must be happy that he didn't win anything at all. The $0 \prize\ would have made him upset more than likely. I'm sure he would have preferred the $95 prize; though; but; as I said; he must be pleased that he won anything at all.
He is disappointed he didnt win the most but satisfied he didnt win the least.
I think he feels relieved that he didn't get zero and slightly happy with his winnings.
Relieved that he didn't get 0 dollars. But probably bummed out that he didn't more than twice that amount that he won by landing on 95; but he's probably happy regardless about 40 dollars.
Feels happy. There is a $0 on the board; so it is a lot of relief not to get 0.
good!  He has $40; and is very glad he didn't land on $0.
Josh is excited to win anything at all.  That $0 on the wheel was making him nervous.  Although the odds were equal at winning any amount; he's happy he won something.  It would have been nicer if he would have landed on $95.
better that nothing
Tom should be excited.  He had the possibility of not winning any money; so winning $40 is great.
George felt non surprised that he won the most common amount.
He probably feels satisfied. He didn't win $95; but $40 is still much better than $0.
Pretty happy about it
He is moderately happy because he is not surprised that he won the medium sized prize due to the ods being in his favor.
Not bad. It's better than 0; which he could have won. 
Charlie is happy with winning $40 because he could have gotten $0.
I would say he is relatively pleased.  The outcome could have been worse.  He did win when he could've gotten nothing.  I'm sure he would have rather have won $95; though.
Feeling great; wish it was grand prize though; but $0 would have been bad
Jacob feels good. He won some money; so with the chance to win $0 he has to be happy. 
Neutral with a little relief.  It wasn't the big amount; but it wasn't zero either; and it was dangerously close to being that.  Also; the middle amount was the biggest spot; and; therefore; the most likely to land on; so it wasn't unexpected.
I think Charlie feels lucky to win some money; but figured he would. He knew he held the highest chance of winning either amount of money and probably wishes it was the larger amount instead; yet the smaller amount of money has a slightly larger spot on the board. It probably turned out the way he predicted it would.
Mike has a good attitude. Mike figured that $40 is better than zero.
Jacob probably expected to spin $40 since that section of the wheel is greater than that of $95 and $0.
He feels relieved and very happy!!
He was very happy since the odds were moderately against his favor.
He feels great about winning the 95 because the lare 1/4 slice of 0$ winnings was a very real possibility; and the other option ; 40 isn't even half of what he won.  He had great luck in the spin; and won the best prize possible!
Mike is very happy. He can really use the $95. This is the best possible outcome.
Bob won the highest amount and avoided landing on the $0 option; he is very happy.
Eric is probably elated that he won $95; seeing as it was the best possible outcome and there was a good chance he'd win less money or even nothing at all.
He feels excited and happy. Possibly surprised that he barely won the maximum amount. Probably feels relieved. Not disappointed or sad at all. 
He's happy. He won the maximum amount. 
very good
Extremely happy. Highest prize when there was a chance of winning nothing.  Middle prize had highest odds so he conquered the odds.
very relieved. big difference between winning and losing in this game and chances of winning were high. 
I feel he would be very happy because he could of won nothing if it was just a few inches over.  He won the most amount on the wheel that he could of won.
Mike is feeling amazing. Hit the jackpot
really happy; he won the highest amount.
The player will be extremely happy at the outcome; as it is the highest amount on the board.
Excellent! He thought he would get $40 so $95 was a nice surprise. 
awesome he won the biggest amount
He is excited he won the most.
He would feel like jumping up and down!
He probably didn't feel that good. This is the lowest possible amount he could have won.
Probably pretty excited that he won; but he may be disappointed that he didn't get the $50 or the $75. That's what I normally see on game shows.
I think he feels okay.  Maybe a little disappointed that he didn't get \lucky;\ but he knew that $10 was the most likely outcome.
George probably feels like this was going to happen. He may have had his hopes up for the bigger prizes; but the $10 prize had a much bigger probability of happening.
Eric was more or less expecting to win $10; so he is happy with the result but longs for another chance to spin and earn more.
He is content he won the smallest about but he had a larger probability to get that amount.
He's disappointed but not surprised. He didn't expect to make 75 dollars; He hoped for at least 50; tho.
not too happy.  knowing that more than half of your chances means that you win something isn't too bad.  granted; his chances of winning 50 or 75 weren't too bad either.  but he's not walking away empty handed; so he's not too happy; but not sad or mad; i guess just kinda happy.  somewhere in the middle.
He is probably very unhappy because of the fact that the spinner stopped VERY CLOSE to the 75 dollars section. Seriously; he must be upset and unhappy.
I think he was really hoping for the $50 or $75; but he probably expected to win the $10 since the portion is so large.
he probably feels pretty sad. the $10 is the lowest amount. He'd probably feel cheated.
Josh was probably disappointed but not all together surprised.  It had the greatest odds but the prize is way lower than the other two.
He feels a bit let down. But he knew that $10 was most likely what he was going to win because it's the largest sized; so he's not surprised.
Charlie is likely upset; as he won the lowest amount possible.
Bob most likely expected to spin $10; but was hoping for $50 or $75. The chance of spinning $10; however; was much greater.
Tom is disappointed he didn't win more.
He is dissapointedt but not surprised to have won the smallest prize
mad it wasnt bigger but expecting it
He feels okay; since he predicted he would probably win 10 dollars.
Eric should not be surprised at winning the lowest.  Over half the wheel was the lowest amount.  At least its probably more than what he had prior to playing so he should be happy.
Mike is very disappointed he did not win more then just 10 dollars\n
He feels kind of bad. The other prizes were so much larger than $10 that he cannot help himself but be disappointed. 
Josh is displeased; but he understands the outcome. He had a very high chance of only winning $10.
Jacob got gyped!  He got the smallest prize and is feeling pretty angry; it was easy to make $10 but he was hoping to get the big jackpot.  He's probably regretting his spin and wishing he could do it all over again.
Eric is disappointed; but not too unhappy. It would have been nice to have a higher amount; but the odds were against him and he feels that $10 is better than nothing.
Alex is probably sad and frustrated that he got a wheel with a very high chance of getting little money.
pretty good.  he had slightly larger chance of winning the 50 vs the 75; but his chances of winning 10 were huge; so beating those odds made him happy.
Bob probably feels pretty good as more than half the wheel was for the $10 amount; so getting five times that amount with only about a quarter chance of winning that much would make him happy.
I think he felt very happy. There's a extremely large chance of only winning $10; but he won more than that anyway.
Jake is very happy. Jake has a smile across his face; he is excited for the next spin.
Tom still feels pretty lucky; since there was like a 60% chance he'd only earn $10. He probably hopes his odds don't keep going down at this rate.
Pretty good; he won some money but not the highest.
George is sure to be happy. He could have easily won $10. Instead he got 5 times that amount with a smaller chance.
Bob feels great about winning $50.  He knew his chances of winning $10 was much higher than landing on $50.
Jacob probably feels pretty good with his results. He didn't get the least amount of money which was attached to the largest part of the pie (wheel) but received the middle amount which isn't terrible. 
James should be happy with the outcome.  He had about a 60% chance of winning only $10; so winning $50 should be a relief.
Happy because he won the middle amount on the wheel.
George is quite happy and feels relieved.  He was worried he would only win $10 and was pleasantly surprised to win $50 instead.
Happy
He would be a bit excited that he just won %50
David is pleased with the results. He avoided the large $10 area and managed to win the middle amount of $50.
greatt
Jake won the second highest amount; so he is happy where he is. He could have gone higher or lower but he got in the middle and that is decent; so he is satisfied. 
Frank should feel good. While he won the middle amount. He should be happy since the odds were that would have won $10 since that is the largest piece of the wheel and the most likely outcome. He beat the odds.
he would be happy
Pretty good about it; glad he didn't hit 10
Alex is pleased even though he didn't win the highest amount.  The chances of him winning only $10 was very great; so he beat the odds and won a substantial amount of money.
Tom is pretty satisfied. He avoided the 10$ low prize and got 50$.
Jacob is pretty happy. That was a good spin on his part. $50 is nothing to complain about
he is happy to win the middle amount
Josh is happy since chances were he would win $10 and he won $50.  He wishes he had won $75 but chance was higher.
John is reasonably happy to have won $50. He would have preferred to win $75; but he is very happy that the marker wheel didn't stop at $10; since this was the highest probability.
Beat the odds for a pretty good payday!
glad it went past the 10$ and on to the 50$. excited he won the top prize
Great!
wow not bad
Fifty bucks is the magic number that makes George happy; and he just won that amount on the wheel. He's very happy.
He is a little happy; and a little depressed. He wishes he would have won the 75
It's not the most; and it's not the least. It's a decent amount. 
Tom feels lucky and relieved that he beat the odds. He is happy to have $50.
He probably thinks that he is very lucky. There is a low chance of a person landing on $75 when spinning the wheel.
He feels amazing! There is a huge chance for just $10; but he won the biggest amount.
Jake is pumped! He had a small chance to win the full 75$ but he got it!
I think Charlie feels exhilarated to win the highest amount. He feels lucky that the pointer landed within the smallest portion of the wheel.
Tom can't believe that he landed on the biggest prize. He thought for sure he'd get the $10 because the win area was larger.
Yay for the most money! Especially since that wasn't the highest odds.
Charlie is extremely happy with his outcome. He has won the most money possible.
He feels excited and lucky; as the chances for winning the $ 75 weren't that high.
I feel Charlie would be very happy with what he won.  He probably didn't think it would land on $75 because that is the smallest section on the wheel and also a lot more than the smallest amount of $10.
the odds of getting the bigger price were very little. Charlie must be extremely happy
Eric feels lucky since lowest chance was to win the $75 and he won it.
James is feeling amazing. Hardest mark to hit; and struck it. He's feeling really lucky; and really good at the same time
happy that he has won the most money that was avaliable
Jake is really excited. The roulette landed on the smallest part and the biggest reward.
He beat the odds; he must be feeling good. The space was smallest; the award was highest. That means he accomplished something hard to get.
lucky he won the largest amount on the smallest odds
Josh is not surprised at all that he ended up with $10.  After all; there was about a 60% chance that he'd get it.  At least he walks away with something though.
lucky and happy. gunslinger won out.
greattttt
He probably feels very lucky; since there was only a small chance that he would win the greatest amount possible. He probably also feels hopeful about the next round.
Didn't think Steve was going to win 75.  Good for him. 
I think he was happy he won; but was a little dissapointed he did not win a higher value.
i think he felt happy that he won 55 but wishes that he would have won more
David is somewhat pleased. He could have won a lot more; so he is not as happy as he could be.  However; $55 is a decent amount of money; so he is glad to have spun the wheel.
He feels fairly happy although; the fact that he had a 75% chance of getting a larger prize makes him a little upset.
Charlie has mixed feeling.  He's happy to have won the $55. But he can't help feeling sad about winning the lowest amount there was to win.
I think he's still happy because $55 is a nice prize!
No! Totally disappointed that he just won the least amount of the money on the wheel. But at least it's something!
Disappointed
Upset because of the amount of money he could have one
Tom feels cheated that he had more than a 50% chance of winning $70 but instead he won the smaller amount ($55).
Though it is the least amount in the wheel. he will be happy with the amount won as it is a good amount.
Jacob feels okay about it. Even though it would have been better to land on the higher prizes; $55 still isn't too bad. 
Well; that was a bit close to $85; so that might be disappointing. It's also the lowest amount of money and the $70 had the biggest odds.
Jacob walks away from the wheel of money pretty pleased.  He's $55 bucks richer!
Yeah!  Going to get married need some money for a ring.  Going to las vagas!
Frank is ok with the outcome; but not particularly pleased. He managed to land on the smallest denomination; and given how much more likely $70 was; he feels unlucky.
a little sad. won the least money possible. odds were he would win more based on the portions of the other amounts.
I think he probably feels okay.  He won the least amount of money he could have; but it's not that different in terms of absolute quantity than the higher amounts.
I think he feels good that he won 55 dollars but I think he would feel better because he could've won more.
Happy because 55 is good money; but disappointed it's the lowest amount.
Tom is happy with $55; but he really wanted it to be more. If he would have spun at a different speed he believes he could have won more money.
George is kinda sad that he didn't land on the other two options with more reward.
He's probably feeling bummed.  He received the lowest value on the board.  He actually had a better chance to win $70 but it didn't work out.
Eric is content with his $55 even though it is the smallest amount.
He probably feels pretty good. He won the middle amount; though he had over a 50% chance of winning that much; anyway.
James feels slightly disappointed that he didn't win the largest amount of $85; but he's happy that he got more than the minimum of $55.
Very happy he won the most he could
Jake is probably very excited to have won $70; although he had about a 50% chance of landing on that section.
He feels great. This was the biggest amount; so it couldn't get any better.
he felt good because he wont a good amount; but wished he got the $85
He is happy that he won money and he won the amount that he was expecting to because it takes up most of the board.
I kinda expected that...50% chance.
Bob is very pleased and excited! He would have been happy with any amount on this wheel. He looks forward to spending it.
John is on a roll today
glade he won the $70
Happy that it wasn't the lowest amount but wishes it could have been more
He is very relieved to have won more than 55 dollars
Happy because he won the second largest amount possible.
Josh feels good; but wish it was the grand prize. Still a much better pay out than the low end
He would be little bit happy
Jacob is happy and he was expecting to land on $70 anyways as it has the higher probability.  Jacob knew the other ones would be a longshot. 
I knew Charlie was going to get 70.  Not a bad win. 
James is probably pretty happy; but was probably expecting to win $70. He might be a little disappointed he didn't get $85.
John is very happy.
very happy. can't go wrong with getting the highest chance of 70$
He probably feels very happy about this. He probably feels very glad that he won the most possible.
Excited. He won the most he could win on this wheel.
I think he's happy. He won the maximum amount. 
He feels happy and excited.
Very excited and enthusiastic that he won the highest amount that you are able to win with a spin. 
I'm sure he feels great.  Winning $85 is a positive thing.  The percentages were against it; but it worked out.
Frank couldn't be any more pleased with the amount of money he won.  The outcome could not have been any better.
He's very excited. He won the larger amount; even though the wheel was unfairly balanced. He feels lucky.
Mike probably feels great! This is the best outcome. The 70 would have been nice too; since its only a little less; but the $85 is better!
Woe that is super
Tom is happy that he won $85. Tom is readying his next spin; he feels he can do better.
He is thrilled and felt great!!
George should feel great. Like Bob; he won the most he could. He too bested the odds since that piece is smallest and thus has the smallest chance of having it land there. Bob should be very happy.
ecstatic about winning the highest amount 
Tom's probably excited to have gotten the most possible money from his spin. He's probably glad he didn't get 55; and feeling pretty lucky.
Really happy he won 85 bucks.
James should be happy.  He hit the highest amount with the lowest chance.  I don't think he really could have gone wrong spinning because any of the amounts were pretty good winnings.
He would feel pretty lucky to win so much!
Knowing that he had such a safe chance of taking home one of the top two amounts; Scott should feel even more satisfaction that he landed on the less probable \best\ outcome.
i'm sure he feels very lucky and happy with the outcome.
He's very happy! He was expecting 55 dollars; and instead got 85. He's surprised.
Yes jackpot! Thank you so much! Wou\nD like to thank my mom.
I think he feels happy. He got the most money and the spot with the lowest probability.
he is overjoyed because the won the highest amount he could have
Exciting because it was the most money. It also had low odds.
He's excited and surprised. He didn't think he would win. 
david is happy.\ndavid is excited.\nhe is glad it's not $55 or $70
Happy because he won the largest amount and the are was small.
Great he would feel because it was a smaller section with highest payout.
Steve is excited he won the largest amount of money.
He is happy with $50 but wishes it was $75 or $90.
Some what disappointed.  He got the lowest prize.  The middle prize had the highest odds of winning.
Frank is likely upset; as he had the greatest chance of winning $75 dollars (~50% of the wheel); but only won $50; which is likely to upset him 1) because it is less than $75; 2) it is the least amount of money on the wheel; and 3) he had lower odds of winning $50 than $75.
Cool. He could've won more but winning $50 is still nice.
Tom is disappointed.  The odds were for him to win more than $50 and he feels unlucky.  He's surprised and sad with the outcome.
Disappointed. He only won the lowest amount possible and it was very close to winning more.
Jacob won the lowest amount; so he is probably disappointed he didn't win as much as he could; but he is probably happy he still got a rather large amount. 
Charlie is happy he won 50 dollars because it is still a fair amount of money and so close to the other amounts he might have won.  He only had a small chance of wining the most.  What he won is 2/3 rds of what he most probobly would have won; the 75 dollars.  I bet he feels great!
I think he feels disappointed. He got the smallest amount of money he could get on the wheel. There was an over 50% chance of getting $75; and he didn't even get that.
sad since he won the least amount of money possible especially with the size of the other two options.
Frank is somewhat pleased. He won the lowest amount possible. But he is still happy to have won $50; which is a decent amount of cash.
david is happy.\ndavid is excited.\nhe wishes it was $90or even $75
Poor Bob; misse dit by a little bit. Still better than nothing.
He would feel happy!
George is probably not excited.  He had more than 50% chance to win $75 but managed to land on the section with the smallest payout
I think he feels okay; but maybe a little disappointed.  He had a better chance of winning $75; but $50 is still pretty good.
Mike is upset. He feels badly about it since he did after all still win $50; but he knows he had a chance at $90; and an even higher chance at $75; so the $50 has left him with a bit of a bitter taste.
Disappointed.
Happy and Excited.
Disappointed but can't complain
Annoyed that there was more than a 50% chance of winning more money but hey; fifty bucks is fifty bucks.
I think he would be mad because $75 is very big on the wheel and he didn't win that.  He won the smallest amount of all of the amounts on the wheel and it was one of the smaller spots.
He is upset that he won the lowest amount. He is depressed
still winning can i play all day?
I think Charlie liked winning 50 dollars but feels like he could've won more.
hes feeling greatful that he got so much. he was happy he got somethg
He probably wishes he had won more.
Eric is very pleased. He did not win the highest prize; but he did not win the lowest prize either. The amount he won is a substantial amount; so he is glad to have played the game.
I imagine that George felt pretty decent about winning the $75.  Winning is always much better than losing.
He feel happy; yet he think he would be totally happier of he win $90 instead.
I think he feels excited because he's 75 dollars richer than he was before he spun the wheel.
very happy that he won the most he could win
he feels that he did well by winning 75
Neutral. It's the middle amount and the biggest spot on the board so it was the expected result.
He feels awesome!
He probably feels equally lucky and unlucky. There was a high chance of a person spinning $75.
He may have expected this to happen. He is probably happy about it but he probably wishes he got 90 instead. 
That's a lot of cash. I bet Jake is thrilled. He probably wants to spin again
very happy
He felt ok; could have been better...or worse
Scott won the middle amount with about 50% probability of being landed on. He probably feels pretty good.
This would be the expected outcome; I'd imagine; so Frank probably feels pretty happy with how things turned out.
Nice! He could've won more; but also could've won less. He's happy with the outcome. 
Mike probably feels pretty good. He had a 50% chance of getting $75; which was the middle of the three amounts listed.
Eric is thrilled to win $75; given that he had a chance to win less or more; he is happy settling on the middle ground and taking home his winnings.
Satisfied.  He hot the middle prize; but that had the most likely odds of winning.  Could have done better or worse.
I think he feels neutral-good; he knew he was going to win a nice amount of money no matter what bbut he got a little more than he was expecting.
I think he is happy with $75 but may wish that he had landed on $90.
Josh is feeling good; but not great. He was definitely hoping for $90; but by the looks of it $75 had the best odds. $50 mark had the second highest odds with a $25 loss
Frank feels pretty good about it. He won the second largest amount which was also the largest section which made it likely to get.
Chris was probably not very surprised and content winning $75. It had a 50% chance of coming up and is only $15 less than the highest prize.
Jacob feels good. Chances were he would win $75 and he did.
he is happy but he won the amount that he was expecting to win since it was the amount that took up the majority of the wheel
Jake is happy because he won the median amount; it was more likely that he would land on the $75 amount than any other.
Excited he won more than 50 but disappointed that he didnt win 90. Overall he is satisfied. 
goof
George was prepared to win 75 because it was such a large percentage of the wheel.  He was neither ecstatic nor sad about his winnings; but content.
Charlie was very happy.
Frank is pleased. But pretty much what he expected.
