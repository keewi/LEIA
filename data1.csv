Not great; there was close to a 50% chance of winning a higher amount; but at least he still won a little.
Disappointed that he didn't get $70 or $80.
sad because he won the lowest amount.
Kindof disappointed. He won a little bit; which is good; but far less than he could have.
Disappointed; but not surprised.  He got the lowest prize but that had nearly the same odds as the two higher prizes combined.
