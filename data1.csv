Disappointed; but not surprised.  He got the lowest prize but that had nearly the same odds as the two higher prizes combined.
He feels content because he now has $15 but not as happy as he would've if it was the $80.
Chris probably isn't disappointed at only winning $15.  Although it wasn't the best outcome; Chris knew this was the most probable result.
